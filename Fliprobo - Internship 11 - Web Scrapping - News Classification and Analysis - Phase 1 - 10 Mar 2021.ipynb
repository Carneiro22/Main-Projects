       "      <td>From January 4, the premise of Kuthiramalika Palace in Thiruvananthapuram will come alive for the next 10 days as the palace ground will resonate with mellifluous renditions by music prodigies as part of the Swathi Sangeethotsavam.The annual music festival is observed as homage to Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. Apart from being a musical extravaganza, the fete also ensures to popularise the compositions of Swathi Thirunal.Each year the festival witnesses big-wigs as well as upcoming talents, says its organiser Aswathy Thirunal Rama Varma, a successor of Swathi Tirunal and a singer and veena artiste himself. “It has been entertaining the city since 1999. And being the organiser I have always tried to include fresh faces for the event. This is apart from those eminent singers who haven’t participated in the event before and young talents who are sure to keep the tradition of classical music alive. The compositions performed here are strictly based on works by Swathi Thirunal.”The festival will kick off with a performance by young artiste Palghat R Ramprasad, who would be accompanied by Avaneeswaram S R Vinu on violin, G Babu on mridangam and Perukavu P L Sudheer on ghatam.The second day will mark the first performance of popular artiste Manda Sudharani at the fete also known as Kuthiramalika Festival. She will be performing with her daughter Sruti Ravali.“Sruti performed well at the national-level competition Naad-Bhed - The Mystery of Sound, which was conducted by Doordarshan, and is now a renowned figure in the classical music arena. My aim was to introduce such music talents who aren’t that familiar and let our audience experience their rich renditions,” he says.Another such duo who will be performing is S Ashok and M B Hariharan popularly known as Bangalore Brothers.Singer Tamarakkad Govindan Namboodiri will entertain the audience this year too. “The artiste has dedicated his life to nadopasana and it is a rare phenomenon to watch the veteran’s concert as he performs only once or twice a year. He made his debut at the festival last year and conveyed his interest to perform this year too as he said he felt a divine atmosphere when he performed the last time at the mandapam,” says Rama Varma.The highlight of the fest this year will be the concert by flautist Amith Nadig from Bengaluru on January 9. “It is a percussion concert which is a rare event in the festival. This concert will stand out as Somashekhar Jois will support the flautist through konnakol, an art of performing percussion syllables vocally. Their performance promises to amuse even those who are not well versed with the classical music genre as it is all about just music and rhythms. Somashekshar will render the konnakol for around three hours with Amith,” says Rama Varma.Meanwhile participants such as singer Amrutha Venkatesh, who will be performing ninth time, are excited to be part of it. “It is an honour to get featured in the prolific music event. I also get a chance to experience the performance of veterans of classical music and also learn the rare compositions of the Swathi Tirunal. The audience too come from across the country and even abroad to attend the annual event,” says Amrutha.This year, she plans to start her concert Pada Varnam. “It has lyrics for all the swarams. The specialities of Swathi Tirunal Pada Varnams are the beautiful swara aksharams that are embedded,” she says.The event is open to all music enthusiasts, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, says Rama Varma. “I welcome everyone who loves music to experience classical melodies,” he concludes.</td>\n",

According to the filmmaker, the movie, which will have major portions shot in Thailand, is a tribute of sorts to the yesteryear Hindi film with same name. Rana surprised his social media followers by releasing a still from the project on New Year’s Eve. While the actor will essay the role of Bandev, an environmental activist in the movie, Prabu confirms that Tollywood actor Varun Tej, too, will play a crucial role.He says, “Both Rana and Varun have equally importance roles. For now, the plan is such that the film will be made in Telugu and Hindi, and will later be dubbed in Tamil. Apart from Varun Tej, senior actor Kota Srinivasa Rao has also been brought on board. Internationally-acclaimed lensman Alphonse Roy, who has made films for BBC, National Geographic and Discovery, will crank the camera for the project. The crew will start shooting in Thailand from January 25 to March. A few portions will be shot in Kerala, too.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>People in Lucknow are now used to seeing stars shooting in their city: Govind Namdev</td>\n",
       "      <td>By Prachi AryaGovind Namdev, best known for his villainous characters in films like The Bandit Queen and Oh My God, had been shooting for a film in the city recently. We caught up with the actor for a tete-a-tete. \"My shooting experience in Lucknow was fabulous. I am very positive about Lucknow. The way people cooperated and behaved, is way better than any other small town and city. People here have now, I think, got used to seeing stars shooting in the city, which has made them so familiar with the atmosphere. No one disturbs the shoot. Mujhe bahut achha lag raha hai yahan shooting karna,\" he says.Namdev has also shot in the city for the film Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana last year. Recalling those days, he says, \"We shot at various spots in the city and we were here for a very long time. The support that we got from the people really helped us to shoot. There was some kind of positivity that is observed here.\"Govind, who’s mostly played villainous characters, says that he always wanted to play a villain. \"When I came to Mumbai from Delhi, I observed one thing that Hindi films have only three types of roles that are the centre of attraction - the hero, heroine and villain. I was too old at that time to be a hero and the slot for heroine was not for me. So in the end, being a villain was my last resort. From then I started doing roles which were actually successful whether it was in Shola Aur Shabnam, Lajja or Virasat,\" says the actor.For the actor, portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram in Bandit Queen was one of the most difficult and challenging roles of his acting career. Govind tells us that even his family members were not supportive of the kind of role he played in the movie. \"My wife started hating me when she saw my character in the film. She was shocked and disturbed to see me like this. Her first reaction after watching the film was to kill me. Even I was shocked as to how can a person be so cruel and brutal in real life. Portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram was indeed a challenging task for me,\" says he, adding, \"There is a story behind this character. During my shooting days, we went to Chambal and I was very confused regarding my character as I had never done this kind of role earlier. I only knew that I had to play a character that is obnoxious. There was no research work regarding the character. Since the film was based on Phoolan Devi, we had to visit the jail where she was imprisoned, for the narration of the story. Dolly Ahluwalia, who was looking after the costumes, urged to meet Phoolan Devi and when she went to meet her she came back crying. On being asked she told us how Phoolan Devi had narrated her entire story and that’s when she showed her how the Thakur had plucked flesh from her chest when she was raped. So this helped me to know about the intricacies of the character that I had to portray. Ab jab-jab log woh film dekhte hain, toh mujhe gaali zaroor padti hai.\"Completing his silver jubilee on screen and spending more than 25 years in Bollywood, Govind feels that a lot of transitions have taken place in acting as well as storylines and filmmaking over the years. \"There is change in every 10 years in Bollywood in terms of content, storyline, and issues. I still remember the movies that were made 20 years ago. The filmmakers focussed on social issues, they were not commercial. Jo bhi content tha it used to be society oriented and moral-centric. There used to be a moral or lesson in every film. Koi na koi aisi baat hoti thi jo public ko achhi lage and it used to spread a spirit of positivity among the masses. And the makers used to denote a lot of time to one film so that it goes beyond perfection. But now with the advancement of technology, filmmaking has also gone under a lot of alterations. Aajkal ki films ka total commercial angle hai and plus the investment of money is so high that it is making people think in that manner and somehow a person gets deprived of the real ethics and essence of filmmaking because of high investment. Now since past two-three years, films are going more towards biopic, realistic issues which are of low budget and are highly appreciated by the people. We are now trying in to get into the shoes of the Western culture. For example, movies like Dangal, they searched for children to play the young Phogat sisters and then train them and even roped in people from abroad for stunts, which was pretty much evident when we saw it on the big screen.\"Talking about that one character he would still love to play, Namdev says, \"I have played all kinds of characters in this last 25 years and I have no desperation for more characters. But if you ask me about a character that I want to play, then I think playing Hitler would be my first preference. The character of Hitler used to interest me even as a kid as he was a poet, a romantic person, a writer. And I used to think that a person with so much of artistic sensibility, suddenly how can he become so ruthless and start killing thousands of people. This transition inside a person’s psychology fascinates me to play that character,\" says the actor.Namdev also shot for a film in Banaras. Talking about his experience in the holy city, he says, \"We shot on the ghats and roads and the public really helped us. And we got some interesting locations to shoot at as well in Banaras. I made a promise to myself that I will come again in future with my family and stay at the ghats to experience the mystic aura of the Ganga and the ghats of Banaras,\" said he.</td>\n",

Apart from being a musical extravaganza, the fete also ensures to popularise the compositions of Swathi Thirunal.Each year the festival witnesses big-wigs as well as upcoming talents, says its organiser Aswathy Thirunal Rama Varma, a successor of Swathi Tirunal and a singer and veena artiste himself. “It has been entertaining the city since 1999. And being the organiser I have always tried to include fresh faces for the event. This is apart from those eminent singers who haven’t participated in the event before and young talents who are sure to keep the tradition of classical music alive. The compositions performed here are strictly based on works by Swathi Thirunal.”The festival will kick off with a performance by young artiste Palghat R Ramprasad, who would be accompanied by Avaneeswaram S R Vinu on violin, G Babu on mridangam and Perukavu P L Sudheer on ghatam.The second day will mark the first performance of popular artiste Manda Sudharani at the fete also known as Kuthiramalika Festival. She will be performing with her daughter Sruti Ravali.“Sruti performed well at the national-level competition Naad-Bhed - The Mystery of Sound, which was conducted by Doordarshan, and is now a renowned figure in the classical music arena. My aim was to introduce such music talents who aren’t that familiar and let our audience experience their rich renditions,” he says.Another such duo who will be performing is S Ashok and M B Hariharan popularly known as Bangalore Brothers.Singer Tamarakkad Govindan Namboodiri will entertain the audience this year too. “The artiste has dedicated his life to nadopasana and it is a rare phenomenon to watch the veteran’s concert as he performs only once or twice a year. He made his debut at the festival last year and conveyed his interest to perform this year too as he said he felt a divine atmosphere when he performed the last time at the mandapam,” says Rama Varma.The highlight of the fest this year will be the concert by flautist Amith Nadig from Bengaluru on January 9. “It is a percussion concert which is a rare event in the festival. This concert will stand out as Somashekhar Jois will support the flautist through konnakol, an art of performing percussion syllables vocally. Their performance promises to amuse even those who are not well versed with the classical music genre as it is all about just music and rhythms. Somashekshar will render the konnakol for around three hours with Amith,” says Rama Varma.Meanwhile participants such as singer Amrutha Venkatesh, who will be performing ninth time, are excited to be part of it. “It is an honour to get featured in the prolific music event. I also get a chance to experience the performance of veterans of classical music and also learn the rare compositions of the Swathi Tirunal. The audience too come from across the country and even abroad to attend the annual event,” says Amrutha.This year, she plans to start her concert Pada Varnam. “It has lyrics for all the swarams. The specialities of Swathi Tirunal Pada Varnams are the beautiful swara aksharams that are embedded,” she says.The event is open to all music enthusiasts, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, says Rama Varma. “I welcome everyone who loves music to experience classical melodies,” he concludes.  \n",

According to the filmmaker, the movie, which will have major portions shot in Thailand, is a tribute of sorts to the yesteryear Hindi film with same name. Rana surprised his social media followers by releasing a still from the project on New Year’s Eve. While the actor will essay the role of Bandev, an environmental activist in the movie, Prabu confirms that Tollywood actor Varun Tej, too, will play a crucial role.He says, “Both Rana and Varun have equally importance roles. For now, the plan is such that the film will be made in Telugu and Hindi, and will later be dubbed in Tamil. Apart from Varun Tej, senior actor Kota Srinivasa Rao has also been brought on board. Internationally-acclaimed lensman Alphonse Roy, who has made films for BBC, National Geographic and Discovery, will crank the camera for the project. The crew will start shooting in Thailand from January 25 to March. A few portions will be shot in Kerala, too.”  \n",

       "4  By Prachi AryaGovind Namdev, best known for his villainous characters in films like The Bandit Queen and Oh My God, had been shooting for a film in the city recently. We caught up with the actor for a tete-a-tete. \"My shooting experience in Lucknow was fabulous. I am very positive about Lucknow. The way people cooperated and behaved, is way better than any other small town and city. People here have now, I think, got used to seeing stars shooting in the city, which has made them so familiar with the atmosphere. No one disturbs the shoot. Mujhe bahut achha lag raha hai yahan shooting karna,\" he says.Namdev has also shot in the city for the film Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana last year. Recalling those days, he says, \"We shot at various spots in the city and we were here for a very long time. The support that we got from the people really helped us to shoot. There was some kind of positivity that is observed here.\"Govind, who’s mostly played villainous characters, says that he always wanted to play a villain. \"When I came to Mumbai from Delhi, I observed one thing that Hindi films have only three types of roles that are the centre of attraction - the hero, heroine and villain. I was too old at that time to be a hero and the slot for heroine was not for me. So in the end, being a villain was my last resort. From then I started doing roles which were actually successful whether it was in Shola Aur Shabnam, Lajja or Virasat,\" says the actor.For the actor, portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram in Bandit Queen was one of the most difficult and challenging roles of his acting career. Govind tells us that even his family members were not supportive of the kind of role he played in the movie. \"My wife started hating me when she saw my character in the film. She was shocked and disturbed to see me like this. Her first reaction after watching the film was to kill me. Even I was shocked as to how can a person be so cruel and brutal in real life. Portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram was indeed a challenging task for me,\" says he, adding, \"There is a story behind this character. During my shooting days, we went to Chambal and I was very confused regarding my character as I had never done this kind of role earlier. I only knew that I had to play a character that is obnoxious. There was no research work regarding the character. Since the film was based on Phoolan Devi, we had to visit the jail where she was imprisoned, for the narration of the story. Dolly Ahluwalia, who was looking after the costumes, urged to meet Phoolan Devi and when she went to meet her she came back crying. On being asked she told us how Phoolan Devi had narrated her entire story and that’s when she showed her how the Thakur had plucked flesh from her chest when she was raped. So this helped me to know about the intricacies of the character that I had to portray. Ab jab-jab log woh film dekhte hain, toh mujhe gaali zaroor padti hai.\"Completing his silver jubilee on screen and spending more than 25 years in Bollywood, Govind feels that a lot of transitions have taken place in acting as well as storylines and filmmaking over the years. \"There is change in every 10 years in Bollywood in terms of content, storyline, and issues. I still remember the movies that were made 20 years ago. The filmmakers focussed on social issues, they were not commercial. Jo bhi content tha it used to be society oriented and moral-centric. There used to be a moral or lesson in every film. Koi na koi aisi baat hoti thi jo public ko achhi lage and it used to spread a spirit of positivity among the masses. And the makers used to denote a lot of time to one film so that it goes beyond perfection. But now with the advancement of technology, filmmaking has also gone under a lot of alterations. Aajkal ki films ka total commercial angle hai and plus the investment of money is so high that it is making people think in that manner and somehow a person gets deprived of the real ethics and essence of filmmaking because of high investment. Now since past two-three years, films are going more towards biopic, realistic issues which are of low budget and are highly appreciated by the people. We are now trying in to get into the shoes of the Western culture. For example, movies like Dangal, they searched for children to play the young Phogat sisters and then train them and even roped in people from abroad for stunts, which was pretty much evident when we saw it on the big screen.\"Talking about that one character he would still love to play, Namdev says, \"I have played all kinds of characters in this last 25 years and I have no desperation for more characters. But if you ask me about a character that I want to play, then I think playing Hitler would be my first preference. The character of Hitler used to interest me even as a kid as he was a poet, a romantic person, a writer. And I used to think that a person with so much of artistic sensibility, suddenly how can he become so ruthless and start killing thousands of people. This transition inside a person’s psychology fascinates me to play that character,\" says the actor.Namdev also shot for a film in Banaras. Talking about his experience in the holy city, he says, \"We shot on the ghats and roads and the public really helped us. And we got some interesting locations to shoot at as well in Banaras. I made a promise to myself that I will come again in future with my family and stay at the ghats to experience the mystic aura of the Ganga and the ghats of Banaras,\" said he.  "

I have been asked not to let out any information about the film. In fact, I can’t say whether it is a female-centric movie or not.

After Oviya making headlines for signing up a few projects and Raiza’s film debut, it is now the turn of Julie to foray into Kollywood. We hear that she is doing a pivotal role in a yet-to-be-titled movie, which stars Thappattam fame Sudhakar in an important role.While Julie was reluctant to reveal details about the project, she told us, “All I can say is that I have a strong role in the film. I have been asked not to let out any information about the film. In fact, I can’t say whether it is a female-centric movie or not. An official announcement will be made by the makers on Pongal, after which the film will go on floors.”  "

       "      <td>When Hari Shanker, a software engineer, and Archana, a freelance make-up artiste, made public their decision to go childless, their families were flabbergasted. But the bigger shock came three years into their marriage, when the couple, who live in Kakkanad, went ahead and adopted two kittens, who are now their ‘children’. “It was a carefully thought out decision for us not to have children. Since we are not planning to have kids, why not get pets, we thought. The decision to get Persian cats was also made after long deliberation, considering the size of our apartment and the temperament of the different breeds,” says Hari. And that was how Ikru, a white and grey Persian, entered their lives, in October 2017. “In the shop, Ikru was found curled up with another black and white kitten. But since we had decided to take only one, we took just him. But then Ikru was a bit lonely, and on a whim, we went back to the shop to see if the other kitten was still there. All but him had been sold! We immediately brought him too home, that was Boo.”The two are constantly playing, and are very much attached to their parents but have their preferences, apparently. While Boo loves to cuddle upto Archana all the time and purr, Ikroo’s favourite sleeping place is on Hari’s legs, even as he works on his laptop. Their only worry now is that they are not able to take along the kittens during their travels. Hari’s job involves travelling abroad many months of the year, and he takes Archana along as well. “As of now, we put them up in boarding but we are researching on options to take them along.”They do everything possible to keep their furry kids safe and healthy, including regular visits to the vet. “I wouldn’t say they have completed us as we were already complete. They have filled our lives with happiness,” says Archana. “People call us crazy. For them, they’re just cats, animals. But we actually prefer them to kids. We have friends abroad who don’t find it all that crazy. There are plenty of couples in the West who opt to be childless for 10-15 years or for good, and have pets instead. I’m not saying I’m aping them, but it’s an inspiration and comfort when people alienate us,” says Archana. It's also because people aren't familiar with having pets at home, or haven't known their love, she says. “I always had cats at home but they were new to Hari as his family are not pet lovers. I was a bit apprehensive how he would accept them but today, he loves and takes care of them much more than me,” she says.At the same time, most of us in our State believe that the planet belongs to human beings, and that all else are encroachers, according to her. “There is also a fixed belief that studying certain subjects, getting married to certain kind of people and having kids is the ‘right’ thing to do, and the only way of life. I have no such notions. The kittens don’t expect anything in return for the kind of love they give us, and nothing makes us happier.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Born and brought up in Mumbai, even as a little child, Padma Shankar could decode any kind of tune. “My mother, Lakshmi Narayanan, is a vocalist and vainika, and any song she would sing, I could tell its swaras. So, she felt that the violin would be the right instrument for me to take up, as you need to have a keen sense of swaras to play the music. She wanted to be a musician, but couldn’t, so she wanted me to live her dream,” begins Padma Shankar.After learning Carnatic vocal under her mother, she started learning the violin under Ramakrishna Sharma, a disciple of Lalgudi Jayaraman. When she got to meet the great violinist in Mumbai, she told him that she wanted to do advance training under him.She states that while Ramakrishna Sharma was a music teacher, Lalgudi Jayaraman was a performer, a musician, a musicologist and a teacher all rolled into one. And that made a huge difference. “When a performer is your teacher, he grooms you for the stage. It’s like going to a finishing school,” she says and elaborates, “He taught me how much music you should have and how much you should present — the balance between learning and performing, what you can perform on stage, and what your stage demeanour should be. For example, when you are learning the violin, you just play it, and you are mostly looking down. But he taught me how to face the audience as I’m playing because when hundreds of people are looking at me, I cannot establish a connect with them, my audience, if I’m looking down. So, the first grooming lesson was how to sit erect while playing the violin. He made me practice looking at myself in the mirror, saying, ‘First, look into your own eyes. If you can’t see your own eyes, where can you see the audience’,” she recalls.She describes Lalgudi Jayaraman a treasure house of music. While he taught his style of music, he also wanted his students to express it in their own ways. Padma likens it to how the same kind of dress needs to be adapted differently to fit two different persons. “He would say, ‘The ragas are the same, the swaras are the same, but some things might suit you more than they suit me, and you will have to figure them out by yourself’. So, you will have the flavour of Lalgudi Jayaraman’s style, but still hear Padma’s music,” she states and adds that she is still developing that because it is very difficult to get out of the shadow cast by someone as legendary as Lalgudi Jayaraman. “There is nothing he hasn’t tried. So, it is a huge task,” she quips.She calls herself “an adventurous musician” because she tries to fit in her style of music into different genres. “I’ve been lucky because the instrument I play is, as Lalgudi sir used to say, a ‘sarva vyaapi’ — omnipresent. You can see it being used in Carnatic music, western classical, film music, pop, jazz, folk… everywhere,” she gushes.Padma feels that there is a lot of difference between an instrumentalist who has learnt vocals and one who hasn’t. “There is an amount of emotion involved when you are a vocalist. And you have the meaning of the lyrics in your heart, and that makes a lot of difference. The movement of the bow in our Indian music is called the ‘gayaki style’ — the singing style. It is important we follow this style because words are important in our music,” explains the violinist.Adapting, rather than unlearning, is what is important when playing fusion music, she informs. “Even when I play a Christmas carol, people will remark that I’m playing a Christmas carol in Carnatic style — even if I’m not playing so. It is intrinsic. I think the beauty lies in not adapting entirely, but giving the music a part of your culture. I don’t think any music tradition has the kind of gamakas that Carnatic music has,” she states.Padma has also dabbled in film music, playing for the likes of Karthik Raaja, Harris Jayaraj, and Achu. She has also been part of the re-recording of many films. “The precision of re-recording is amazing. In a classical background, you have a free style. In a film set-up, you will get 10 seconds in which you need to play three bars, so your precision has to be higher and that is what I find challenging,” she says.During the December season, she can be seen on stage as an accompanist and also as a solo violinist, and Padma says that there is quite a difference in these two roles. “As an accompanist, you are mainly complementing the vocalist, while in a solo concert, you are the queen,” she describes.In December 2017, she had the honour of playing at the prestigious Savai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, as a soloist, the first Carnatic violinist to do so. “It was an audience of 12,000 people and I played abhangs on the violin. I played Purandaradasa’s Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma, not in our traditional style, but the way Bhimsen Joshi sang. That was very well received,” she shares.She admits that Chennai is full of purists, “but if you get them to nod their heads and say, ‘Bhesh’ or ‘Bhale’, then you can make your mark in any corner of the world”. “We also have people who like explorations and experimentations by musicians, especially among the younger generation. The audience is opening of late,” she feels.The Margazhi music festival had to contend with natural disasters for the past couple of years, resulting in fewer audiences, but this season, too, the audience hasn’t increased a lot, Padma feels. “A lot of our music is being freely webcast, so many people have started to feel that it is a big task to go to listen to live music. This is quite sad because when you listen to music in a live ambience, it is a totally different experience; it’s just like how there is a huge difference between watching a movie in a theatre and in your home. The energy you feel in a live concert is totally stimulating,” she says.She also agrees that there are so many concerts happening during the season that the audience gets confused. “There is too much choice. We’ve got into a situation where there is a kutcheri happening every other street,” she feels. But she thinks that giving opportunities to youngsters is a good thing. “Performing is very different from learning. When someone gets on to the stage to perform, it is a different ball game. No matter the size of the audience, if you are on stage and facing a bunch of people sitting in the audience, that becomes a learning experience. The audience for the early morning concerts and the junior concerts are usually families of the youngsters cheering them on, but every musician has passed that stage,” she says.She also feels that social media has to lead to the audience opening up to younger talents and leading to discovery of many talents. “It is much better than what we had. In our days, it was usually our guru’s recommendation or word-of-mouth that led to audiences turning up for our concerts, but now, almost every budding musician has a YouTube page. They are advertising their concert on Facebook and people become aware of it and go check their work online and decide to attend their concerts, which is great,” shesigns off.</td>\n",

       "      <td>After their sizzling chemistry in Bairavaa, Vijay and Keerthy Suresh will once again pair up for AR Murugadoss’s next. A source close to the actress confirms, “Yes, she has been confirmed for the project. It will be an interesting role for Keerthy.” Currently, the actress is busy with the promotions of her upcoming Tamil and Telugu releases and she will soon join the shoot.The source adds, “The team had organised a look test for Vijay on January 2. Murugadoss is likely to begin shooting for the project after Pongal. And the film will most probably go on floors in Chennai.”We hear that like Murugadoss’s earlier projects, this one, too, will touch upon a pressing issue. It was only recently that the team had officially confirmed that AR Rahman will be scoring music for the film. Interestingly, this is the first time Murugadoss is collaborating with Rahman for a Tamil film; the duo had worked together for the Hindi remake of Ghajini, which marked the director’s Bollywood debut. With biggies roped in for the project, looks like #Thalapathy62 is making the right noises!Read the story in Malayalam here</td>\n",

But the bigger shock came three years into their marriage, when the couple, who live in Kakkanad, went ahead and adopted two kittens, who are now their ‘children’. “It was a carefully thought out decision for us not to have children. Since we are not planning to have kids, why not get pets, we thought. The decision to get Persian cats was also made after long deliberation, considering the size of our apartment and the temperament of the different breeds,” says Hari. And that was how Ikru, a white and grey Persian, entered their lives, in October 2017. “In the shop, Ikru was found curled up with another black and white kitten. But since we had decided to take only one, we took just him. But then Ikru was a bit lonely, and on a whim, we went back to the shop to see if the other kitten was still there. All but him had been sold! We immediately brought him too home, that was Boo.”The two are constantly playing, and are very much attached to their parents but have their preferences, apparently. While Boo loves to cuddle upto Archana all the time and purr, Ikroo’s favourite sleeping place is on Hari’s legs, even as he works on his laptop. Their only worry now is that they are not able to take along the kittens during their travels. Hari’s job involves travelling abroad many months of the year, and he takes Archana along as well. “As of now, we put them up in boarding but we are researching on options to take them along.”They do everything possible to keep their furry kids safe and healthy, including regular visits to the vet. “I wouldn’t say they have completed us as we were already complete. They have filled our lives with happiness,” says Archana. “People call us crazy. For them, they’re just cats, animals. But we actually prefer them to kids. We have friends abroad who don’t find it all that crazy. There are plenty of couples in the West who opt to be childless for 10-15 years or for good, and have pets instead. I’m not saying I’m aping them, but it’s an inspiration and comfort when people alienate us,” says Archana. It's also because people aren't familiar with having pets at home, or haven't known their love, she says. “I always had cats at home but they were new to Hari as his family are not pet lovers. I was a bit apprehensive how he would accept them but today, he loves and takes care of them much more than me,” she says.At the same time, most of us in our State believe that the planet belongs to human beings, and that all else are encroachers, according to her. “There is also a fixed belief that studying certain subjects, getting married to certain kind of people and having kids is the ‘right’ thing to do, and the only way of life. I have no such notions. The kittens don’t expect anything in return for the kind of love they give us, and nothing makes us happier.”  \n",
       "1  Born and brought up in Mumbai, even as a little child, Padma Shankar could decode any kind of tune. “My mother, Lakshmi Narayanan, is a vocalist and vainika, and any song she would sing, I could tell its swaras. So, she felt that the violin would be the right instrument for me to take up, as you need to have a keen sense of swaras to play the music. She wanted to be a musician, but couldn’t, so she wanted me to live her dream,” begins Padma Shankar.After learning Carnatic vocal under her mother, she started learning the violin under Ramakrishna Sharma, a disciple of Lalgudi Jayaraman. When she got to meet the great violinist in Mumbai, she told him that she wanted to do advance training under him.She states that while Ramakrishna Sharma was a music teacher, Lalgudi Jayaraman was a performer, a musician, a musicologist and a teacher all rolled into one. And that made a huge difference. “When a performer is your teacher, he grooms you for the stage. It’s like going to a finishing school,” she says and elaborates, “He taught me how much music you should have and how much you should present — the balance between learning and performing, what you can perform on stage, and what your stage demeanour should be. For example, when you are learning the violin, you just play it, and you are mostly looking down. But he taught me how to face the audience as I’m playing because when hundreds of people are looking at me, I cannot establish a connect with them, my audience, if I’m looking down. So, the first grooming lesson was how to sit erect while playing the violin. He made me practice looking at myself in the mirror, saying, ‘First, look into your own eyes. If you can’t see your own eyes, where can you see the audience’,” she recalls.She describes Lalgudi Jayaraman a treasure house of music. While he taught his style of music, he also wanted his students to express it in their own ways. Padma likens it to how the same kind of dress needs to be adapted differently to fit two different persons. “He would say, ‘The ragas are the same, the swaras are the same, but some things might suit you more than they suit me, and you will have to figure them out by yourself’. So, you will have the flavour of Lalgudi Jayaraman’s style, but still hear Padma’s music,” she states and adds that she is still developing that because it is very difficult to get out of the shadow cast by someone as legendary as Lalgudi Jayaraman. “There is nothing he hasn’t tried. So, it is a huge task,” she quips.She calls herself “an adventurous musician” because she tries to fit in her style of music into different genres. “I’ve been lucky because the instrument I play is, as Lalgudi sir used to say, a ‘sarva vyaapi’ — omnipresent. You can see it being used in Carnatic music, western classical, film music, pop, jazz, folk… everywhere,” she gushes.Padma feels that there is a lot of difference between an instrumentalist who has learnt vocals and one who hasn’t. “There is an amount of emotion involved when you are a vocalist. And you have the meaning of the lyrics in your heart, and that makes a lot of difference. The movement of the bow in our Indian music is called the ‘gayaki style’ — the singing style. It is important we follow this style because words are important in our music,” explains the violinist.Adapting, rather than unlearning, is what is important when playing fusion music, she informs. “Even when I play a Christmas carol, people will remark that I’m playing a Christmas carol in Carnatic style — even if I’m not playing so. It is intrinsic. I think the beauty lies in not adapting entirely, but giving the music a part of your culture. I don’t think any music tradition has the kind of gamakas that Carnatic music has,” she states.Padma has also dabbled in film music, playing for the likes of Karthik Raaja, Harris Jayaraj, and Achu. She has also been part of the re-recording of many films. “The precision of re-recording is amazing. In a classical background, you have a free style. In a film set-up, you will get 10 seconds in which you need to play three bars, so your precision has to be higher and that is what I find challenging,” she says.During the December season, she can be seen on stage as an accompanist and also as a solo violinist, and Padma says that there is quite a difference in these two roles. “As an accompanist, you are mainly complementing the vocalist, while in a solo concert, you are the queen,” she describes.In December 2017, she had the honour of playing at the prestigious Savai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, as a soloist, the first Carnatic violinist to do so. “It was an audience of 12,000 people and I played abhangs on the violin. I played Purandaradasa’s Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma, not in our traditional style, but the way Bhimsen Joshi sang. That was very well received,” she shares.She admits that Chennai is full of purists, “but if you get them to nod their heads and say, ‘Bhesh’ or ‘Bhale’, then you can make your mark in any corner of the world”. “We also have people who like explorations and experimentations by musicians, especially among the younger generation. The audience is opening of late,” she feels.The Margazhi music festival had to contend with natural disasters for the past couple of years, resulting in fewer audiences, but this season, too, the audience hasn’t increased a lot, Padma feels. “A lot of our music is being freely webcast, so many people have started to feel that it is a big task to go to listen to live music. This is quite sad because when you listen to music in a live ambience, it is a totally different experience; it’s just like how there is a huge difference between watching a movie in a theatre and in your home. The energy you feel in a live concert is totally stimulating,” she says.She also agrees that there are so many concerts happening during the season that the audience gets confused. “There is too much choice. We’ve got into a situation where there is a kutcheri happening every other street,” she feels. But she thinks that giving opportunities to youngsters is a good thing. “Performing is very different from learning. When someone gets on to the stage to perform, it is a different ball game. No matter the size of the audience, if you are on stage and facing a bunch of people sitting in the audience, that becomes a learning experience. The audience for the early morning concerts and the junior concerts are usually families of the youngsters cheering them on, but every musician has passed that stage,” she says.She also feels that social media has to lead to the audience opening up to younger talents and leading to discovery of many talents. “It is much better than what we had. In our days, it was usually our guru’s recommendation or word-of-mouth that led to audiences turning up for our concerts, but now, almost every budding musician has a YouTube page. They are advertising their concert on Facebook and people become aware of it and go check their work online and decide to attend their concerts, which is great,” shesigns off.  \n",

Suresh will once again pair up for AR Murugadoss’s next. A source close to the actress confirms, “Yes, she has been confirmed for the project. It will be an interesting role for Keerthy.” Currently, the actress is busy with the promotions of her upcoming Tamil and Telugu releases and she will soon join the shoot.The source adds, “The team had organised a look test for Vijay on January 2. Murugadoss is likely to begin shooting for the project after Pongal. And the film will most probably go on floors in Chennai.”We hear that like Murugadoss’s earlier projects, this one, too, will touch upon a pressing issue. It was only recently that the team had officially confirmed that AR Rahman will be scoring music for the film. Interestingly, this is the first time Murugadoss is collaborating with Rahman for a Tamil film; the duo had worked together for the Hindi remake of Ghajini, which marked the director’s Bollywood debut. With biggies roped in for the project, looks like #Thalapathy62 is making the right noises!Read the story in Malayalam here  \n",

       "      <td>Probably, no actress in Mollywood has ever done the character that Sshivada will be playing in her next in Malayalam.In director Sugeeth’s upcoming Kunchacko Boban starrer Shikkari Shambhu, the Su…Su…Sudhi Vathmeekam actress is playing a butcher named Anitha.“I have so far been a girl-next-door onscreen and have never tried something of this sort before,” says an excited Sshivada. Interestingly, she is a vegetarian in real life! “It wasn’t easy in the beginning,” she admits. “I couldn’t stand the sight or the smell of raw meat. But I had to do it for the character and finally, I guess I got used to it over time.” In her scenes, she works wearing a messy, stained shirt. “That’s what Anitha looks like while at work. But she appears in normal saris and salwars too,” Sshivada says.All of her portions were shot inside a forest but hey, Sshivada was no rookie at it. “Even my first movie Nedunchalai had a lot of scenes in the forest, so I was kind of used to it. But the days at Bhoothathankettu did offer me some first-time experiences,” she reveals. “I saw a boa for the first time! Everyone on the set kept talking about seeing elephants, about how they once trampled down a set for a temple, and I was wondering why I didn’t see any. On the day of my pack-up, I saw not one, but seven of them right next to my vehicle. It was a family, with elders and the young ones,” she recollects excitedly.Sshivada is also shooting for her Tamil film Iravaakalam, directed by Maya fame Ashwin Saravanan, which also has S J Surya and Wamiqa Gabbi in the lead roles. “My character in it, Madhumita, is a girl who goes around film sets asking for a chance to act. She is quite stylish compared to the characters I have done, and I also have a wider range of emotions to play for her.” Sshivada has been shooting in Chennai and Ootty for the film. The shoot for her next in Malayalam, Chanakyathanthram, in which she plays the CEO of a company, is also going on alongside.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mayor wants to crush and flush; activists say #KitchenPulveriserBeda</td>\n",
       "      <td>The recent call by Bengaluru Mayor Sampath Raj to make kitchen pulverisers mandatory (to reduce solid kitchen waste from going into landfills) has experts seeing red. Kitchen pulverisers — small electric grinder machines installed below kitchen sink that crush any food dumped into it into an almost liquid form — are popular in the West, but activists say that it is just not viable in a city like Bengaluru that lacks the infrastructure that cities in the West do. Therefore, it will only add to our woes.Members of the Bangalore Eco Team recently started a petition online to garner support of Bengalureans and meet the Mayor to show him that the city is not for this form of garbage disposal. “When we met the Mayor earlier about the construction debris issue, he told us about making kitchen pulverisers mandatory for hotels and new houses. We told him then that it’s a bad idea. Our STP (sewerage treatment plant) expert, environment engineer Dr Ananth S Kodavasal, had a couple for meetings with the Mayor and other officials and explained the impact this will have on STPs. Our lakes are already struggling with under capacity STPs, and at this point to introduce another input will clog drains; the city saw flooding in October, all because of clogged drains. We expressed this to the Mayor, but even after that he told the press about making it mandatory. We were about 30-35 activists then, so we thought that we should garner larger support (via the online petition) and get back to him to show that the citizens don’t support this,” says Seema Sharma of the Bangalore Eco Team.The team suggests that there are better and simpler ways of keeping waste out of landfills, such as composting. “If anything needs to be mandated — like Seattle in USA, Havana in Cuba and closer home in Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram — it should be composting on premises. Our city isn’t able to handle sewerage at this point; we can’t add to the load with pulverizing. The BBMP began composting santhes, and, in June, they mooted making composting on premises mandatory, but nothing has been implemented. When we spoke to BWSSB officials, they had no idea about how to take care of crushed food. Pulverisers require a lot of water to drain out the crushed waste — how feasible is that when we are already suffering from water shortage? If we have to copy the West, we need infrastructure like them. When we have good home solutions, such as composting, why ape anyone else? Take a note from Alappuzha, which is among the five cities in the world that are working towards curbing pollution through their sustainable solid waste management practices. They achieved this only by making composting and bio gas mandatory, for which the government provides high subsidies for this. We should be implementing that here,” adds Seema.ADDING TO OUR WOESThe Bangalore Eco Team says that there are many drawbacks to kitchen pulverisers, such as…Waste of fresh water: Each kitchen will need between 10-20 litres of extra fresh water every day to flush down the pulverised food. The city already has acute water shortage.The food will kill STPs: When the crushed food is added to the sewage, its biological oxygen demand will more than double. That means our STPs have to double their capacity overnight. Our STPs are not designed for this load. They will simply fail, and we will have to discharge partially treated sewage to the drains and lakes.The oil and fat content will cause foaming in STPs, kill bacteria: People will pour their used oil and fat in the kitchen sink, which will directly reach the STPs. The fat content will cause a blanket of thick, brown foam on STP tanks, which lowers the efficiency of the bacteria and reduce aeration.The food sludge will block sewerage pipes: Our drainage system is mainly gravity-fed, not pumped. In this type of pipelines, when the sewage flow slows down, it leaves sediments behind. Thus, the sediment builds up gradually and reduces the flow even further. Ultimately it will block the pipe completely.Flooding will get aggravated: Bengaluru sees regular flooding, and when drains are blocked with food sludge, the flooding will increase multifold. When pipes are blocked, the raw sewage will burst out of the manholes and flow freely across the roads.Lakes and drains will be filled with raw sewage and food mix: When STPs belonging to apartments and BWSSB are killed, the raw sewage will reach the drains and lakes. This will kill even those lakes that have recently been rejuvenated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Boat-wreck is a translation of Rabindranath Tagore’s Bengali novel Noukadubi, by Arunava Sinha. As the title suggests, the novel is the story of a boat wreck, and the ensuing catastrophe it brings about in two families. Adorned with evocative language and exquisite depictions of nature, The Boat-Wreck is a moving tale of human lives stuck between the wheels of fortune, and of complicated human relationships.Two wedding parties drown in a boat wreck with the only survivors being one of the bridegrooms Ramesh, and the other party’s bride, Kamala. Kamala and Ramesh, who had not seen their respective partners before their wedding, believe they are married to each other as they try to move on from their recent misfortunes and settle in each other’s company. The story takes a turn as a wonderful romance brews between the couple -- a very meek Kamala and a caring Ramesh. Though he gets to spot the error soon, Ramesh, full of remorse, remains attracted to her. But their cosy world soon collapses as Kamala leaves him the moment she comes to know the truth. A series of adventures take both Kamala and Ramesh to Benaras, where they meet each other again in the most unlikely of circumstances. In a poetic narrative full of charismatic encounters, Tagore weaves a tale of love, fate and emotional upheavals.Tagore has always been known as one of the most farsighted philosophers. Even if some parts of the novel may seem dated, Tagore has portrayed certain nuances of society that are still relevant. Arunava Sinha’s language effortlessly blends with Tagore’s diction making the read a poetic experience. Written with Tagore’s philosophical insight and romantic fervour, The Boat-wreck is an early twentieth-century depiction of love that goes beyond ownership. ­­­­How critics view the book:Gulzar said in a review, \"Tagore picks up the flotsam of a love story from the Ganga and narrates it like only he can. An eternal human story.\"</td>\n",

Interestingly, she is a vegetarian in real life! “It wasn’t easy in the beginning,” she admits. “I couldn’t stand the sight or the smell of raw meat. But I had to do it for the character and finally, I guess I got used to it over time.” In her scenes, she works wearing a messy, stained shirt. “That’s what Anitha looks like while at work. But she appears in normal saris and salwars too,” Sshivada says.All of her portions were shot inside a forest but hey, Sshivada was no rookie at it. “Even my first movie Nedunchalai had a lot of scenes in the forest, so I was kind of used to it. But the days at Bhoothathankettu did offer me some first-time experiences,” she reveals. “I saw a boa for the first time! Everyone on the set kept talking about seeing elephants, about how they once trampled down a set for a temple, and I was wondering why I didn’t see any. On the day of my pack-up, I saw not one, but seven of them right next to my vehicle. It was a family, with elders and the young ones,” she recollects excitedly.Sshivada is also shooting for her Tamil film Iravaakalam, directed by Maya fame Ashwin Saravanan, which also has S J Surya and Wamiqa Gabbi in the lead roles. “My character in it, Madhumita, is a girl who goes around film sets asking for a chance to act. She is quite stylish compared to the characters I have done, and I also have a wider range of emotions to play for her.” Sshivada has been shooting in Chennai and Ootty for the film. The shoot for her next in Malayalam, Chanakyathanthram, in which she plays the CEO of a company, is also going on alongside.  \n",

       "2  The recent call by Bengaluru Mayor Sampath Raj to make kitchen pulverisers mandatory (to reduce solid kitchen waste from going into landfills) has experts seeing red. Kitchen pulverisers — small electric grinder machines installed below kitchen sink that crush any food dumped into it into an almost liquid form — are popular in the West, but activists say that it is just not viable in a city like Bengaluru that lacks the infrastructure that cities in the West do. Therefore, it will only add to our woes.Members of the Bangalore Eco Team recently started a petition online to garner support of Bengalureans and meet the Mayor to show him that the city is not for this form of garbage disposal. “When we met the Mayor earlier about the construction debris issue, he told us about making kitchen pulverisers mandatory for hotels and new houses. We told him then that it’s a bad idea. Our STP (sewerage treatment plant) expert, environment engineer Dr Ananth S Kodavasal, had a couple for meetings with the Mayor and other officials and explained the impact this will have on STPs. Our lakes are already struggling with under capacity STPs, and at this point to introduce another input will clog drains; the city saw flooding in October, all because of clogged drains. We expressed this to the Mayor, but even after that he told the press about making it mandatory. We were about 30-35 activists then, so we thought that we should garner larger support (via the online petition) and get back to him to show that the citizens don’t support this,” says Seema Sharma of the Bangalore Eco Team.The team suggests that there are better and simpler ways of keeping waste out of landfills, such as composting. “If anything needs to be mandated — like Seattle in USA, Havana in Cuba and closer home in Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram — it should be composting on premises. Our city isn’t able to handle sewerage at this point; we can’t add to the load with pulverizing. The BBMP began composting santhes, and, in June, they mooted making composting on premises mandatory, but nothing has been implemented. When we spoke to BWSSB officials, they had no idea about how to take care of crushed food. Pulverisers require a lot of water to drain out the crushed waste — how feasible is that when we are already suffering from water shortage? If we have to copy the West, we need infrastructure like them. When we have good home solutions, such as composting, why ape anyone else? Take a note from Alappuzha, which is among the five cities in the world that are working towards curbing pollution through their sustainable solid waste management practices. They achieved this only by making composting and bio gas mandatory, for which the government provides high subsidies for this. We should be implementing that here,” adds Seema.ADDING TO OUR WOESThe Bangalore Eco Team says that there are many drawbacks to kitchen pulverisers, such as…Waste of fresh water: Each kitchen will need between 10-20 litres of extra fresh water every day to flush down the pulverised food. The city already has acute water shortage.The food will kill STPs: When the crushed food is added to the sewage, its biological oxygen demand will more than double. That means our STPs have to double their capacity overnight. Our STPs are not designed for this load. They will simply fail, and we will have to discharge partially treated sewage to the drains and lakes.The oil and fat content will cause foaming in STPs, kill bacteria: People will pour their used oil and fat in the kitchen sink, which will directly reach the STPs. The fat content will cause a blanket of thick, brown foam on STP tanks, which lowers the efficiency of the bacteria and reduce aeration.The food sludge will block sewerage pipes: Our drainage system is mainly gravity-fed, not pumped. In this type of pipelines, when the sewage flow slows down, it leaves sediments behind. Thus, the sediment builds up gradually and reduces the flow even further. Ultimately it will block the pipe completely.Flooding will get aggravated: Bengaluru sees regular flooding, and when drains are blocked with food sludge, the flooding will increase multifold. When pipes are blocked, the raw sewage will burst out of the manholes and flow freely across the roads.Lakes and drains will be filled with raw sewage and food mix: When STPs belonging to apartments and BWSSB are killed, the raw sewage will reach the drains and lakes. This will kill even those lakes that have recently been rejuvenated.  \n",

As the title suggests, the novel is the story of a boat wreck, and the ensuing catastrophe it brings about in two families. Adorned with evocative language and exquisite depictions of nature, The Boat-Wreck is a moving tale of human lives stuck between the wheels of fortune, and of complicated human relationships.Two wedding parties drown in a boat wreck with the only survivors being one of the bridegrooms Ramesh, and the other party’s bride, Kamala. Kamala and Ramesh, who had not seen their respective partners before their wedding, believe they are married to each other as they try to move on from their recent misfortunes and settle in each other’s company. The story takes a turn as a wonderful romance brews between the couple -- a very meek Kamala and a caring Ramesh. Though he gets to spot the error soon, Ramesh, full of remorse, remains attracted to her. But their cosy world soon collapses as Kamala leaves him the moment she comes to know the truth. A series of adventures take both Kamala and Ramesh to Benaras, where they meet each other again in the most unlikely of circumstances. In a poetic narrative full of charismatic encounters, Tagore weaves a tale of love, fate and emotional upheavals.Tagore has always been known as one of the most farsighted philosophers. Even if some parts of the novel may seem dated, Tagore has portrayed certain nuances of society that are still relevant. Arunava Sinha’s language effortlessly blends with Tagore’s diction making the read a poetic experience. Written with Tagore’s philosophical insight and romantic fervour, The Boat-wreck is an early twentieth-century depiction of love that goes beyond ownership. ­­­­How critics view the book:Gulzar said in a review, \"Tagore picks up the flotsam of a love story from the Ganga and narrates it like only he can. An eternal human story.\"  \n",
