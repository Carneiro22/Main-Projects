       "      <td>From January 4, the premise of Kuthiramalika Palace in Thiruvananthapuram will come alive for the next 10 days as the palace ground will resonate with mellifluous renditions by music prodigies as part of the Swathi Sangeethotsavam.The annual music festival is observed as homage to Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. Apart from being a musical extravaganza, the fete also ensures to popularise the compositions of Swathi Thirunal.Each year the festival witnesses big-wigs as well as upcoming talents, says its organiser Aswathy Thirunal Rama Varma, a successor of Swathi Tirunal and a singer and veena artiste himself. “It has been entertaining the city since 1999. And being the organiser I have always tried to include fresh faces for the event. This is apart from those eminent singers who haven’t participated in the event before and young talents who are sure to keep the tradition of classical music alive. The compositions performed here are strictly based on works by Swathi Thirunal.”The festival will kick off with a performance by young artiste Palghat R Ramprasad, who would be accompanied by Avaneeswaram S R Vinu on violin, G Babu on mridangam and Perukavu P L Sudheer on ghatam.The second day will mark the first performance of popular artiste Manda Sudharani at the fete also known as Kuthiramalika Festival. She will be performing with her daughter Sruti Ravali.“Sruti performed well at the national-level competition Naad-Bhed - The Mystery of Sound, which was conducted by Doordarshan, and is now a renowned figure in the classical music arena. My aim was to introduce such music talents who aren’t that familiar and let our audience experience their rich renditions,” he says.Another such duo who will be performing is S Ashok and M B Hariharan popularly known as Bangalore Brothers.Singer Tamarakkad Govindan Namboodiri will entertain the audience this year too. “The artiste has dedicated his life to nadopasana and it is a rare phenomenon to watch the veteran’s concert as he performs only once or twice a year. He made his debut at the festival last year and conveyed his interest to perform this year too as he said he felt a divine atmosphere when he performed the last time at the mandapam,” says Rama Varma.The highlight of the fest this year will be the concert by flautist Amith Nadig from Bengaluru on January 9. “It is a percussion concert which is a rare event in the festival. This concert will stand out as Somashekhar Jois will support the flautist through konnakol, an art of performing percussion syllables vocally. Their performance promises to amuse even those who are not well versed with the classical music genre as it is all about just music and rhythms. Somashekshar will render the konnakol for around three hours with Amith,” says Rama Varma.Meanwhile participants such as singer Amrutha Venkatesh, who will be performing ninth time, are excited to be part of it. “It is an honour to get featured in the prolific music event. I also get a chance to experience the performance of veterans of classical music and also learn the rare compositions of the Swathi Tirunal. The audience too come from across the country and even abroad to attend the annual event,” says Amrutha.This year, she plans to start her concert Pada Varnam. “It has lyrics for all the swarams. The specialities of Swathi Tirunal Pada Varnams are the beautiful swara aksharams that are embedded,” she says.The event is open to all music enthusiasts, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, says Rama Varma. “I welcome everyone who loves music to experience classical melodies,” he concludes.</td>\n",

According to the filmmaker, the movie, which will have major portions shot in Thailand, is a tribute of sorts to the yesteryear Hindi film with same name. Rana surprised his social media followers by releasing a still from the project on New Year’s Eve. While the actor will essay the role of Bandev, an environmental activist in the movie, Prabu confirms that Tollywood actor Varun Tej, too, will play a crucial role.He says, “Both Rana and Varun have equally importance roles. For now, the plan is such that the film will be made in Telugu and Hindi, and will later be dubbed in Tamil. Apart from Varun Tej, senior actor Kota Srinivasa Rao has also been brought on board. Internationally-acclaimed lensman Alphonse Roy, who has made films for BBC, National Geographic and Discovery, will crank the camera for the project. The crew will start shooting in Thailand from January 25 to March. A few portions will be shot in Kerala, too.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>People in Lucknow are now used to seeing stars shooting in their city: Govind Namdev</td>\n",
       "      <td>By Prachi AryaGovind Namdev, best known for his villainous characters in films like The Bandit Queen and Oh My God, had been shooting for a film in the city recently. We caught up with the actor for a tete-a-tete. \"My shooting experience in Lucknow was fabulous. I am very positive about Lucknow. The way people cooperated and behaved, is way better than any other small town and city. People here have now, I think, got used to seeing stars shooting in the city, which has made them so familiar with the atmosphere. No one disturbs the shoot. Mujhe bahut achha lag raha hai yahan shooting karna,\" he says.Namdev has also shot in the city for the film Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana last year. Recalling those days, he says, \"We shot at various spots in the city and we were here for a very long time. The support that we got from the people really helped us to shoot. There was some kind of positivity that is observed here.\"Govind, who’s mostly played villainous characters, says that he always wanted to play a villain. \"When I came to Mumbai from Delhi, I observed one thing that Hindi films have only three types of roles that are the centre of attraction - the hero, heroine and villain. I was too old at that time to be a hero and the slot for heroine was not for me. So in the end, being a villain was my last resort. From then I started doing roles which were actually successful whether it was in Shola Aur Shabnam, Lajja or Virasat,\" says the actor.For the actor, portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram in Bandit Queen was one of the most difficult and challenging roles of his acting career. Govind tells us that even his family members were not supportive of the kind of role he played in the movie. \"My wife started hating me when she saw my character in the film. She was shocked and disturbed to see me like this. Her first reaction after watching the film was to kill me. Even I was shocked as to how can a person be so cruel and brutal in real life. Portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram was indeed a challenging task for me,\" says he, adding, \"There is a story behind this character. During my shooting days, we went to Chambal and I was very confused regarding my character as I had never done this kind of role earlier. I only knew that I had to play a character that is obnoxious. There was no research work regarding the character. Since the film was based on Phoolan Devi, we had to visit the jail where she was imprisoned, for the narration of the story. Dolly Ahluwalia, who was looking after the costumes, urged to meet Phoolan Devi and when she went to meet her she came back crying. On being asked she told us how Phoolan Devi had narrated her entire story and that’s when she showed her how the Thakur had plucked flesh from her chest when she was raped. So this helped me to know about the intricacies of the character that I had to portray. Ab jab-jab log woh film dekhte hain, toh mujhe gaali zaroor padti hai.\"Completing his silver jubilee on screen and spending more than 25 years in Bollywood, Govind feels that a lot of transitions have taken place in acting as well as storylines and filmmaking over the years. \"There is change in every 10 years in Bollywood in terms of content, storyline, and issues. I still remember the movies that were made 20 years ago. The filmmakers focussed on social issues, they were not commercial. Jo bhi content tha it used to be society oriented and moral-centric. There used to be a moral or lesson in every film. Koi na koi aisi baat hoti thi jo public ko achhi lage and it used to spread a spirit of positivity among the masses. And the makers used to denote a lot of time to one film so that it goes beyond perfection. But now with the advancement of technology, filmmaking has also gone under a lot of alterations. Aajkal ki films ka total commercial angle hai and plus the investment of money is so high that it is making people think in that manner and somehow a person gets deprived of the real ethics and essence of filmmaking because of high investment. Now since past two-three years, films are going more towards biopic, realistic issues which are of low budget and are highly appreciated by the people. We are now trying in to get into the shoes of the Western culture. For example, movies like Dangal, they searched for children to play the young Phogat sisters and then train them and even roped in people from abroad for stunts, which was pretty much evident when we saw it on the big screen.\"Talking about that one character he would still love to play, Namdev says, \"I have played all kinds of characters in this last 25 years and I have no desperation for more characters. But if you ask me about a character that I want to play, then I think playing Hitler would be my first preference. The character of Hitler used to interest me even as a kid as he was a poet, a romantic person, a writer. And I used to think that a person with so much of artistic sensibility, suddenly how can he become so ruthless and start killing thousands of people. This transition inside a person’s psychology fascinates me to play that character,\" says the actor.Namdev also shot for a film in Banaras. Talking about his experience in the holy city, he says, \"We shot on the ghats and roads and the public really helped us. And we got some interesting locations to shoot at as well in Banaras. I made a promise to myself that I will come again in future with my family and stay at the ghats to experience the mystic aura of the Ganga and the ghats of Banaras,\" said he.</td>\n",

Apart from being a musical extravaganza, the fete also ensures to popularise the compositions of Swathi Thirunal.Each year the festival witnesses big-wigs as well as upcoming talents, says its organiser Aswathy Thirunal Rama Varma, a successor of Swathi Tirunal and a singer and veena artiste himself. “It has been entertaining the city since 1999. And being the organiser I have always tried to include fresh faces for the event. This is apart from those eminent singers who haven’t participated in the event before and young talents who are sure to keep the tradition of classical music alive. The compositions performed here are strictly based on works by Swathi Thirunal.”The festival will kick off with a performance by young artiste Palghat R Ramprasad, who would be accompanied by Avaneeswaram S R Vinu on violin, G Babu on mridangam and Perukavu P L Sudheer on ghatam.The second day will mark the first performance of popular artiste Manda Sudharani at the fete also known as Kuthiramalika Festival. She will be performing with her daughter Sruti Ravali.“Sruti performed well at the national-level competition Naad-Bhed - The Mystery of Sound, which was conducted by Doordarshan, and is now a renowned figure in the classical music arena. My aim was to introduce such music talents who aren’t that familiar and let our audience experience their rich renditions,” he says.Another such duo who will be performing is S Ashok and M B Hariharan popularly known as Bangalore Brothers.Singer Tamarakkad Govindan Namboodiri will entertain the audience this year too. “The artiste has dedicated his life to nadopasana and it is a rare phenomenon to watch the veteran’s concert as he performs only once or twice a year. He made his debut at the festival last year and conveyed his interest to perform this year too as he said he felt a divine atmosphere when he performed the last time at the mandapam,” says Rama Varma.The highlight of the fest this year will be the concert by flautist Amith Nadig from Bengaluru on January 9. “It is a percussion concert which is a rare event in the festival. This concert will stand out as Somashekhar Jois will support the flautist through konnakol, an art of performing percussion syllables vocally. Their performance promises to amuse even those who are not well versed with the classical music genre as it is all about just music and rhythms. Somashekshar will render the konnakol for around three hours with Amith,” says Rama Varma.Meanwhile participants such as singer Amrutha Venkatesh, who will be performing ninth time, are excited to be part of it. “It is an honour to get featured in the prolific music event. I also get a chance to experience the performance of veterans of classical music and also learn the rare compositions of the Swathi Tirunal. The audience too come from across the country and even abroad to attend the annual event,” says Amrutha.This year, she plans to start her concert Pada Varnam. “It has lyrics for all the swarams. The specialities of Swathi Tirunal Pada Varnams are the beautiful swara aksharams that are embedded,” she says.The event is open to all music enthusiasts, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, says Rama Varma. “I welcome everyone who loves music to experience classical melodies,” he concludes.  \n",

According to the filmmaker, the movie, which will have major portions shot in Thailand, is a tribute of sorts to the yesteryear Hindi film with same name. Rana surprised his social media followers by releasing a still from the project on New Year’s Eve. While the actor will essay the role of Bandev, an environmental activist in the movie, Prabu confirms that Tollywood actor Varun Tej, too, will play a crucial role.He says, “Both Rana and Varun have equally importance roles. For now, the plan is such that the film will be made in Telugu and Hindi, and will later be dubbed in Tamil. Apart from Varun Tej, senior actor Kota Srinivasa Rao has also been brought on board. Internationally-acclaimed lensman Alphonse Roy, who has made films for BBC, National Geographic and Discovery, will crank the camera for the project. The crew will start shooting in Thailand from January 25 to March. A few portions will be shot in Kerala, too.”  \n",

       "4  By Prachi AryaGovind Namdev, best known for his villainous characters in films like The Bandit Queen and Oh My God, had been shooting for a film in the city recently. We caught up with the actor for a tete-a-tete. \"My shooting experience in Lucknow was fabulous. I am very positive about Lucknow. The way people cooperated and behaved, is way better than any other small town and city. People here have now, I think, got used to seeing stars shooting in the city, which has made them so familiar with the atmosphere. No one disturbs the shoot. Mujhe bahut achha lag raha hai yahan shooting karna,\" he says.Namdev has also shot in the city for the film Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana last year. Recalling those days, he says, \"We shot at various spots in the city and we were here for a very long time. The support that we got from the people really helped us to shoot. There was some kind of positivity that is observed here.\"Govind, who’s mostly played villainous characters, says that he always wanted to play a villain. \"When I came to Mumbai from Delhi, I observed one thing that Hindi films have only three types of roles that are the centre of attraction - the hero, heroine and villain. I was too old at that time to be a hero and the slot for heroine was not for me. So in the end, being a villain was my last resort. From then I started doing roles which were actually successful whether it was in Shola Aur Shabnam, Lajja or Virasat,\" says the actor.For the actor, portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram in Bandit Queen was one of the most difficult and challenging roles of his acting career. Govind tells us that even his family members were not supportive of the kind of role he played in the movie. \"My wife started hating me when she saw my character in the film. She was shocked and disturbed to see me like this. Her first reaction after watching the film was to kill me. Even I was shocked as to how can a person be so cruel and brutal in real life. Portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram was indeed a challenging task for me,\" says he, adding, \"There is a story behind this character. During my shooting days, we went to Chambal and I was very confused regarding my character as I had never done this kind of role earlier. I only knew that I had to play a character that is obnoxious. There was no research work regarding the character. Since the film was based on Phoolan Devi, we had to visit the jail where she was imprisoned, for the narration of the story. Dolly Ahluwalia, who was looking after the costumes, urged to meet Phoolan Devi and when she went to meet her she came back crying. On being asked she told us how Phoolan Devi had narrated her entire story and that’s when she showed her how the Thakur had plucked flesh from her chest when she was raped. So this helped me to know about the intricacies of the character that I had to portray. Ab jab-jab log woh film dekhte hain, toh mujhe gaali zaroor padti hai.\"Completing his silver jubilee on screen and spending more than 25 years in Bollywood, Govind feels that a lot of transitions have taken place in acting as well as storylines and filmmaking over the years. \"There is change in every 10 years in Bollywood in terms of content, storyline, and issues. I still remember the movies that were made 20 years ago. The filmmakers focussed on social issues, they were not commercial. Jo bhi content tha it used to be society oriented and moral-centric. There used to be a moral or lesson in every film. Koi na koi aisi baat hoti thi jo public ko achhi lage and it used to spread a spirit of positivity among the masses. And the makers used to denote a lot of time to one film so that it goes beyond perfection. But now with the advancement of technology, filmmaking has also gone under a lot of alterations. Aajkal ki films ka total commercial angle hai and plus the investment of money is so high that it is making people think in that manner and somehow a person gets deprived of the real ethics and essence of filmmaking because of high investment. Now since past two-three years, films are going more towards biopic, realistic issues which are of low budget and are highly appreciated by the people. We are now trying in to get into the shoes of the Western culture. For example, movies like Dangal, they searched for children to play the young Phogat sisters and then train them and even roped in people from abroad for stunts, which was pretty much evident when we saw it on the big screen.\"Talking about that one character he would still love to play, Namdev says, \"I have played all kinds of characters in this last 25 years and I have no desperation for more characters. But if you ask me about a character that I want to play, then I think playing Hitler would be my first preference. The character of Hitler used to interest me even as a kid as he was a poet, a romantic person, a writer. And I used to think that a person with so much of artistic sensibility, suddenly how can he become so ruthless and start killing thousands of people. This transition inside a person’s psychology fascinates me to play that character,\" says the actor.Namdev also shot for a film in Banaras. Talking about his experience in the holy city, he says, \"We shot on the ghats and roads and the public really helped us. And we got some interesting locations to shoot at as well in Banaras. I made a promise to myself that I will come again in future with my family and stay at the ghats to experience the mystic aura of the Ganga and the ghats of Banaras,\" said he.  "

I have been asked not to let out any information about the film. In fact, I can’t say whether it is a female-centric movie or not.

After Oviya making headlines for signing up a few projects and Raiza’s film debut, it is now the turn of Julie to foray into Kollywood. We hear that she is doing a pivotal role in a yet-to-be-titled movie, which stars Thappattam fame Sudhakar in an important role.While Julie was reluctant to reveal details about the project, she told us, “All I can say is that I have a strong role in the film. I have been asked not to let out any information about the film. In fact, I can’t say whether it is a female-centric movie or not. An official announcement will be made by the makers on Pongal, after which the film will go on floors.”  "

       "      <td>When Hari Shanker, a software engineer, and Archana, a freelance make-up artiste, made public their decision to go childless, their families were flabbergasted. But the bigger shock came three years into their marriage, when the couple, who live in Kakkanad, went ahead and adopted two kittens, who are now their ‘children’. “It was a carefully thought out decision for us not to have children. Since we are not planning to have kids, why not get pets, we thought. The decision to get Persian cats was also made after long deliberation, considering the size of our apartment and the temperament of the different breeds,” says Hari. And that was how Ikru, a white and grey Persian, entered their lives, in October 2017. “In the shop, Ikru was found curled up with another black and white kitten. But since we had decided to take only one, we took just him. But then Ikru was a bit lonely, and on a whim, we went back to the shop to see if the other kitten was still there. All but him had been sold! We immediately brought him too home, that was Boo.”The two are constantly playing, and are very much attached to their parents but have their preferences, apparently. While Boo loves to cuddle upto Archana all the time and purr, Ikroo’s favourite sleeping place is on Hari’s legs, even as he works on his laptop. Their only worry now is that they are not able to take along the kittens during their travels. Hari’s job involves travelling abroad many months of the year, and he takes Archana along as well. “As of now, we put them up in boarding but we are researching on options to take them along.”They do everything possible to keep their furry kids safe and healthy, including regular visits to the vet. “I wouldn’t say they have completed us as we were already complete. They have filled our lives with happiness,” says Archana. “People call us crazy. For them, they’re just cats, animals. But we actually prefer them to kids. We have friends abroad who don’t find it all that crazy. There are plenty of couples in the West who opt to be childless for 10-15 years or for good, and have pets instead. I’m not saying I’m aping them, but it’s an inspiration and comfort when people alienate us,” says Archana. It's also because people aren't familiar with having pets at home, or haven't known their love, she says. “I always had cats at home but they were new to Hari as his family are not pet lovers. I was a bit apprehensive how he would accept them but today, he loves and takes care of them much more than me,” she says.At the same time, most of us in our State believe that the planet belongs to human beings, and that all else are encroachers, according to her. “There is also a fixed belief that studying certain subjects, getting married to certain kind of people and having kids is the ‘right’ thing to do, and the only way of life. I have no such notions. The kittens don’t expect anything in return for the kind of love they give us, and nothing makes us happier.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Born and brought up in Mumbai, even as a little child, Padma Shankar could decode any kind of tune. “My mother, Lakshmi Narayanan, is a vocalist and vainika, and any song she would sing, I could tell its swaras. So, she felt that the violin would be the right instrument for me to take up, as you need to have a keen sense of swaras to play the music. She wanted to be a musician, but couldn’t, so she wanted me to live her dream,” begins Padma Shankar.After learning Carnatic vocal under her mother, she started learning the violin under Ramakrishna Sharma, a disciple of Lalgudi Jayaraman. When she got to meet the great violinist in Mumbai, she told him that she wanted to do advance training under him.She states that while Ramakrishna Sharma was a music teacher, Lalgudi Jayaraman was a performer, a musician, a musicologist and a teacher all rolled into one. And that made a huge difference. “When a performer is your teacher, he grooms you for the stage. It’s like going to a finishing school,” she says and elaborates, “He taught me how much music you should have and how much you should present — the balance between learning and performing, what you can perform on stage, and what your stage demeanour should be. For example, when you are learning the violin, you just play it, and you are mostly looking down. But he taught me how to face the audience as I’m playing because when hundreds of people are looking at me, I cannot establish a connect with them, my audience, if I’m looking down. So, the first grooming lesson was how to sit erect while playing the violin. He made me practice looking at myself in the mirror, saying, ‘First, look into your own eyes. If you can’t see your own eyes, where can you see the audience’,” she recalls.She describes Lalgudi Jayaraman a treasure house of music. While he taught his style of music, he also wanted his students to express it in their own ways. Padma likens it to how the same kind of dress needs to be adapted differently to fit two different persons. “He would say, ‘The ragas are the same, the swaras are the same, but some things might suit you more than they suit me, and you will have to figure them out by yourself’. So, you will have the flavour of Lalgudi Jayaraman’s style, but still hear Padma’s music,” she states and adds that she is still developing that because it is very difficult to get out of the shadow cast by someone as legendary as Lalgudi Jayaraman. “There is nothing he hasn’t tried. So, it is a huge task,” she quips.She calls herself “an adventurous musician” because she tries to fit in her style of music into different genres. “I’ve been lucky because the instrument I play is, as Lalgudi sir used to say, a ‘sarva vyaapi’ — omnipresent. You can see it being used in Carnatic music, western classical, film music, pop, jazz, folk… everywhere,” she gushes.Padma feels that there is a lot of difference between an instrumentalist who has learnt vocals and one who hasn’t. “There is an amount of emotion involved when you are a vocalist. And you have the meaning of the lyrics in your heart, and that makes a lot of difference. The movement of the bow in our Indian music is called the ‘gayaki style’ — the singing style. It is important we follow this style because words are important in our music,” explains the violinist.Adapting, rather than unlearning, is what is important when playing fusion music, she informs. “Even when I play a Christmas carol, people will remark that I’m playing a Christmas carol in Carnatic style — even if I’m not playing so. It is intrinsic. I think the beauty lies in not adapting entirely, but giving the music a part of your culture. I don’t think any music tradition has the kind of gamakas that Carnatic music has,” she states.Padma has also dabbled in film music, playing for the likes of Karthik Raaja, Harris Jayaraj, and Achu. She has also been part of the re-recording of many films. “The precision of re-recording is amazing. In a classical background, you have a free style. In a film set-up, you will get 10 seconds in which you need to play three bars, so your precision has to be higher and that is what I find challenging,” she says.During the December season, she can be seen on stage as an accompanist and also as a solo violinist, and Padma says that there is quite a difference in these two roles. “As an accompanist, you are mainly complementing the vocalist, while in a solo concert, you are the queen,” she describes.In December 2017, she had the honour of playing at the prestigious Savai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, as a soloist, the first Carnatic violinist to do so. “It was an audience of 12,000 people and I played abhangs on the violin. I played Purandaradasa’s Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma, not in our traditional style, but the way Bhimsen Joshi sang. That was very well received,” she shares.She admits that Chennai is full of purists, “but if you get them to nod their heads and say, ‘Bhesh’ or ‘Bhale’, then you can make your mark in any corner of the world”. “We also have people who like explorations and experimentations by musicians, especially among the younger generation. The audience is opening of late,” she feels.The Margazhi music festival had to contend with natural disasters for the past couple of years, resulting in fewer audiences, but this season, too, the audience hasn’t increased a lot, Padma feels. “A lot of our music is being freely webcast, so many people have started to feel that it is a big task to go to listen to live music. This is quite sad because when you listen to music in a live ambience, it is a totally different experience; it’s just like how there is a huge difference between watching a movie in a theatre and in your home. The energy you feel in a live concert is totally stimulating,” she says.She also agrees that there are so many concerts happening during the season that the audience gets confused. “There is too much choice. We’ve got into a situation where there is a kutcheri happening every other street,” she feels. But she thinks that giving opportunities to youngsters is a good thing. “Performing is very different from learning. When someone gets on to the stage to perform, it is a different ball game. No matter the size of the audience, if you are on stage and facing a bunch of people sitting in the audience, that becomes a learning experience. The audience for the early morning concerts and the junior concerts are usually families of the youngsters cheering them on, but every musician has passed that stage,” she says.She also feels that social media has to lead to the audience opening up to younger talents and leading to discovery of many talents. “It is much better than what we had. In our days, it was usually our guru’s recommendation or word-of-mouth that led to audiences turning up for our concerts, but now, almost every budding musician has a YouTube page. They are advertising their concert on Facebook and people become aware of it and go check their work online and decide to attend their concerts, which is great,” shesigns off.</td>\n",

       "      <td>After their sizzling chemistry in Bairavaa, Vijay and Keerthy Suresh will once again pair up for AR Murugadoss’s next. A source close to the actress confirms, “Yes, she has been confirmed for the project. It will be an interesting role for Keerthy.” Currently, the actress is busy with the promotions of her upcoming Tamil and Telugu releases and she will soon join the shoot.The source adds, “The team had organised a look test for Vijay on January 2. Murugadoss is likely to begin shooting for the project after Pongal. And the film will most probably go on floors in Chennai.”We hear that like Murugadoss’s earlier projects, this one, too, will touch upon a pressing issue. It was only recently that the team had officially confirmed that AR Rahman will be scoring music for the film. Interestingly, this is the first time Murugadoss is collaborating with Rahman for a Tamil film; the duo had worked together for the Hindi remake of Ghajini, which marked the director’s Bollywood debut. With biggies roped in for the project, looks like #Thalapathy62 is making the right noises!Read the story in Malayalam here</td>\n",

But the bigger shock came three years into their marriage, when the couple, who live in Kakkanad, went ahead and adopted two kittens, who are now their ‘children’. “It was a carefully thought out decision for us not to have children. Since we are not planning to have kids, why not get pets, we thought. The decision to get Persian cats was also made after long deliberation, considering the size of our apartment and the temperament of the different breeds,” says Hari. And that was how Ikru, a white and grey Persian, entered their lives, in October 2017. “In the shop, Ikru was found curled up with another black and white kitten. But since we had decided to take only one, we took just him. But then Ikru was a bit lonely, and on a whim, we went back to the shop to see if the other kitten was still there. All but him had been sold! We immediately brought him too home, that was Boo.”The two are constantly playing, and are very much attached to their parents but have their preferences, apparently. While Boo loves to cuddle upto Archana all the time and purr, Ikroo’s favourite sleeping place is on Hari’s legs, even as he works on his laptop. Their only worry now is that they are not able to take along the kittens during their travels. Hari’s job involves travelling abroad many months of the year, and he takes Archana along as well. “As of now, we put them up in boarding but we are researching on options to take them along.”They do everything possible to keep their furry kids safe and healthy, including regular visits to the vet. “I wouldn’t say they have completed us as we were already complete. They have filled our lives with happiness,” says Archana. “People call us crazy. For them, they’re just cats, animals. But we actually prefer them to kids. We have friends abroad who don’t find it all that crazy. There are plenty of couples in the West who opt to be childless for 10-15 years or for good, and have pets instead. I’m not saying I’m aping them, but it’s an inspiration and comfort when people alienate us,” says Archana. It's also because people aren't familiar with having pets at home, or haven't known their love, she says. “I always had cats at home but they were new to Hari as his family are not pet lovers. I was a bit apprehensive how he would accept them but today, he loves and takes care of them much more than me,” she says.At the same time, most of us in our State believe that the planet belongs to human beings, and that all else are encroachers, according to her. “There is also a fixed belief that studying certain subjects, getting married to certain kind of people and having kids is the ‘right’ thing to do, and the only way of life. I have no such notions. The kittens don’t expect anything in return for the kind of love they give us, and nothing makes us happier.”  \n",
       "1  Born and brought up in Mumbai, even as a little child, Padma Shankar could decode any kind of tune. “My mother, Lakshmi Narayanan, is a vocalist and vainika, and any song she would sing, I could tell its swaras. So, she felt that the violin would be the right instrument for me to take up, as you need to have a keen sense of swaras to play the music. She wanted to be a musician, but couldn’t, so she wanted me to live her dream,” begins Padma Shankar.After learning Carnatic vocal under her mother, she started learning the violin under Ramakrishna Sharma, a disciple of Lalgudi Jayaraman. When she got to meet the great violinist in Mumbai, she told him that she wanted to do advance training under him.She states that while Ramakrishna Sharma was a music teacher, Lalgudi Jayaraman was a performer, a musician, a musicologist and a teacher all rolled into one. And that made a huge difference. “When a performer is your teacher, he grooms you for the stage. It’s like going to a finishing school,” she says and elaborates, “He taught me how much music you should have and how much you should present — the balance between learning and performing, what you can perform on stage, and what your stage demeanour should be. For example, when you are learning the violin, you just play it, and you are mostly looking down. But he taught me how to face the audience as I’m playing because when hundreds of people are looking at me, I cannot establish a connect with them, my audience, if I’m looking down. So, the first grooming lesson was how to sit erect while playing the violin. He made me practice looking at myself in the mirror, saying, ‘First, look into your own eyes. If you can’t see your own eyes, where can you see the audience’,” she recalls.She describes Lalgudi Jayaraman a treasure house of music. While he taught his style of music, he also wanted his students to express it in their own ways. Padma likens it to how the same kind of dress needs to be adapted differently to fit two different persons. “He would say, ‘The ragas are the same, the swaras are the same, but some things might suit you more than they suit me, and you will have to figure them out by yourself’. So, you will have the flavour of Lalgudi Jayaraman’s style, but still hear Padma’s music,” she states and adds that she is still developing that because it is very difficult to get out of the shadow cast by someone as legendary as Lalgudi Jayaraman. “There is nothing he hasn’t tried. So, it is a huge task,” she quips.She calls herself “an adventurous musician” because she tries to fit in her style of music into different genres. “I’ve been lucky because the instrument I play is, as Lalgudi sir used to say, a ‘sarva vyaapi’ — omnipresent. You can see it being used in Carnatic music, western classical, film music, pop, jazz, folk… everywhere,” she gushes.Padma feels that there is a lot of difference between an instrumentalist who has learnt vocals and one who hasn’t. “There is an amount of emotion involved when you are a vocalist. And you have the meaning of the lyrics in your heart, and that makes a lot of difference. The movement of the bow in our Indian music is called the ‘gayaki style’ — the singing style. It is important we follow this style because words are important in our music,” explains the violinist.Adapting, rather than unlearning, is what is important when playing fusion music, she informs. “Even when I play a Christmas carol, people will remark that I’m playing a Christmas carol in Carnatic style — even if I’m not playing so. It is intrinsic. I think the beauty lies in not adapting entirely, but giving the music a part of your culture. I don’t think any music tradition has the kind of gamakas that Carnatic music has,” she states.Padma has also dabbled in film music, playing for the likes of Karthik Raaja, Harris Jayaraj, and Achu. She has also been part of the re-recording of many films. “The precision of re-recording is amazing. In a classical background, you have a free style. In a film set-up, you will get 10 seconds in which you need to play three bars, so your precision has to be higher and that is what I find challenging,” she says.During the December season, she can be seen on stage as an accompanist and also as a solo violinist, and Padma says that there is quite a difference in these two roles. “As an accompanist, you are mainly complementing the vocalist, while in a solo concert, you are the queen,” she describes.In December 2017, she had the honour of playing at the prestigious Savai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, as a soloist, the first Carnatic violinist to do so. “It was an audience of 12,000 people and I played abhangs on the violin. I played Purandaradasa’s Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma, not in our traditional style, but the way Bhimsen Joshi sang. That was very well received,” she shares.She admits that Chennai is full of purists, “but if you get them to nod their heads and say, ‘Bhesh’ or ‘Bhale’, then you can make your mark in any corner of the world”. “We also have people who like explorations and experimentations by musicians, especially among the younger generation. The audience is opening of late,” she feels.The Margazhi music festival had to contend with natural disasters for the past couple of years, resulting in fewer audiences, but this season, too, the audience hasn’t increased a lot, Padma feels. “A lot of our music is being freely webcast, so many people have started to feel that it is a big task to go to listen to live music. This is quite sad because when you listen to music in a live ambience, it is a totally different experience; it’s just like how there is a huge difference between watching a movie in a theatre and in your home. The energy you feel in a live concert is totally stimulating,” she says.She also agrees that there are so many concerts happening during the season that the audience gets confused. “There is too much choice. We’ve got into a situation where there is a kutcheri happening every other street,” she feels. But she thinks that giving opportunities to youngsters is a good thing. “Performing is very different from learning. When someone gets on to the stage to perform, it is a different ball game. No matter the size of the audience, if you are on stage and facing a bunch of people sitting in the audience, that becomes a learning experience. The audience for the early morning concerts and the junior concerts are usually families of the youngsters cheering them on, but every musician has passed that stage,” she says.She also feels that social media has to lead to the audience opening up to younger talents and leading to discovery of many talents. “It is much better than what we had. In our days, it was usually our guru’s recommendation or word-of-mouth that led to audiences turning up for our concerts, but now, almost every budding musician has a YouTube page. They are advertising their concert on Facebook and people become aware of it and go check their work online and decide to attend their concerts, which is great,” shesigns off.  \n",

Suresh will once again pair up for AR Murugadoss’s next. A source close to the actress confirms, “Yes, she has been confirmed for the project. It will be an interesting role for Keerthy.” Currently, the actress is busy with the promotions of her upcoming Tamil and Telugu releases and she will soon join the shoot.The source adds, “The team had organised a look test for Vijay on January 2. Murugadoss is likely to begin shooting for the project after Pongal. And the film will most probably go on floors in Chennai.”We hear that like Murugadoss’s earlier projects, this one, too, will touch upon a pressing issue. It was only recently that the team had officially confirmed that AR Rahman will be scoring music for the film. Interestingly, this is the first time Murugadoss is collaborating with Rahman for a Tamil film; the duo had worked together for the Hindi remake of Ghajini, which marked the director’s Bollywood debut. With biggies roped in for the project, looks like #Thalapathy62 is making the right noises!Read the story in Malayalam here  \n",

       "      <td>Probably, no actress in Mollywood has ever done the character that Sshivada will be playing in her next in Malayalam.In director Sugeeth’s upcoming Kunchacko Boban starrer Shikkari Shambhu, the Su…Su…Sudhi Vathmeekam actress is playing a butcher named Anitha.“I have so far been a girl-next-door onscreen and have never tried something of this sort before,” says an excited Sshivada. Interestingly, she is a vegetarian in real life! “It wasn’t easy in the beginning,” she admits. “I couldn’t stand the sight or the smell of raw meat. But I had to do it for the character and finally, I guess I got used to it over time.” In her scenes, she works wearing a messy, stained shirt. “That’s what Anitha looks like while at work. But she appears in normal saris and salwars too,” Sshivada says.All of her portions were shot inside a forest but hey, Sshivada was no rookie at it. “Even my first movie Nedunchalai had a lot of scenes in the forest, so I was kind of used to it. But the days at Bhoothathankettu did offer me some first-time experiences,” she reveals. “I saw a boa for the first time! Everyone on the set kept talking about seeing elephants, about how they once trampled down a set for a temple, and I was wondering why I didn’t see any. On the day of my pack-up, I saw not one, but seven of them right next to my vehicle. It was a family, with elders and the young ones,” she recollects excitedly.Sshivada is also shooting for her Tamil film Iravaakalam, directed by Maya fame Ashwin Saravanan, which also has S J Surya and Wamiqa Gabbi in the lead roles. “My character in it, Madhumita, is a girl who goes around film sets asking for a chance to act. She is quite stylish compared to the characters I have done, and I also have a wider range of emotions to play for her.” Sshivada has been shooting in Chennai and Ootty for the film. The shoot for her next in Malayalam, Chanakyathanthram, in which she plays the CEO of a company, is also going on alongside.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mayor wants to crush and flush; activists say #KitchenPulveriserBeda</td>\n",
       "      <td>The recent call by Bengaluru Mayor Sampath Raj to make kitchen pulverisers mandatory (to reduce solid kitchen waste from going into landfills) has experts seeing red. Kitchen pulverisers — small electric grinder machines installed below kitchen sink that crush any food dumped into it into an almost liquid form — are popular in the West, but activists say that it is just not viable in a city like Bengaluru that lacks the infrastructure that cities in the West do. Therefore, it will only add to our woes.Members of the Bangalore Eco Team recently started a petition online to garner support of Bengalureans and meet the Mayor to show him that the city is not for this form of garbage disposal. “When we met the Mayor earlier about the construction debris issue, he told us about making kitchen pulverisers mandatory for hotels and new houses. We told him then that it’s a bad idea. Our STP (sewerage treatment plant) expert, environment engineer Dr Ananth S Kodavasal, had a couple for meetings with the Mayor and other officials and explained the impact this will have on STPs. Our lakes are already struggling with under capacity STPs, and at this point to introduce another input will clog drains; the city saw flooding in October, all because of clogged drains. We expressed this to the Mayor, but even after that he told the press about making it mandatory. We were about 30-35 activists then, so we thought that we should garner larger support (via the online petition) and get back to him to show that the citizens don’t support this,” says Seema Sharma of the Bangalore Eco Team.The team suggests that there are better and simpler ways of keeping waste out of landfills, such as composting. “If anything needs to be mandated — like Seattle in USA, Havana in Cuba and closer home in Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram — it should be composting on premises. Our city isn’t able to handle sewerage at this point; we can’t add to the load with pulverizing. The BBMP began composting santhes, and, in June, they mooted making composting on premises mandatory, but nothing has been implemented. When we spoke to BWSSB officials, they had no idea about how to take care of crushed food. Pulverisers require a lot of water to drain out the crushed waste — how feasible is that when we are already suffering from water shortage? If we have to copy the West, we need infrastructure like them. When we have good home solutions, such as composting, why ape anyone else? Take a note from Alappuzha, which is among the five cities in the world that are working towards curbing pollution through their sustainable solid waste management practices. They achieved this only by making composting and bio gas mandatory, for which the government provides high subsidies for this. We should be implementing that here,” adds Seema.ADDING TO OUR WOESThe Bangalore Eco Team says that there are many drawbacks to kitchen pulverisers, such as…Waste of fresh water: Each kitchen will need between 10-20 litres of extra fresh water every day to flush down the pulverised food. The city already has acute water shortage.The food will kill STPs: When the crushed food is added to the sewage, its biological oxygen demand will more than double. That means our STPs have to double their capacity overnight. Our STPs are not designed for this load. They will simply fail, and we will have to discharge partially treated sewage to the drains and lakes.The oil and fat content will cause foaming in STPs, kill bacteria: People will pour their used oil and fat in the kitchen sink, which will directly reach the STPs. The fat content will cause a blanket of thick, brown foam on STP tanks, which lowers the efficiency of the bacteria and reduce aeration.The food sludge will block sewerage pipes: Our drainage system is mainly gravity-fed, not pumped. In this type of pipelines, when the sewage flow slows down, it leaves sediments behind. Thus, the sediment builds up gradually and reduces the flow even further. Ultimately it will block the pipe completely.Flooding will get aggravated: Bengaluru sees regular flooding, and when drains are blocked with food sludge, the flooding will increase multifold. When pipes are blocked, the raw sewage will burst out of the manholes and flow freely across the roads.Lakes and drains will be filled with raw sewage and food mix: When STPs belonging to apartments and BWSSB are killed, the raw sewage will reach the drains and lakes. This will kill even those lakes that have recently been rejuvenated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Boat-wreck is a translation of Rabindranath Tagore’s Bengali novel Noukadubi, by Arunava Sinha. As the title suggests, the novel is the story of a boat wreck, and the ensuing catastrophe it brings about in two families. Adorned with evocative language and exquisite depictions of nature, The Boat-Wreck is a moving tale of human lives stuck between the wheels of fortune, and of complicated human relationships.Two wedding parties drown in a boat wreck with the only survivors being one of the bridegrooms Ramesh, and the other party’s bride, Kamala. Kamala and Ramesh, who had not seen their respective partners before their wedding, believe they are married to each other as they try to move on from their recent misfortunes and settle in each other’s company. The story takes a turn as a wonderful romance brews between the couple -- a very meek Kamala and a caring Ramesh. Though he gets to spot the error soon, Ramesh, full of remorse, remains attracted to her. But their cosy world soon collapses as Kamala leaves him the moment she comes to know the truth. A series of adventures take both Kamala and Ramesh to Benaras, where they meet each other again in the most unlikely of circumstances. In a poetic narrative full of charismatic encounters, Tagore weaves a tale of love, fate and emotional upheavals.Tagore has always been known as one of the most farsighted philosophers. Even if some parts of the novel may seem dated, Tagore has portrayed certain nuances of society that are still relevant. Arunava Sinha’s language effortlessly blends with Tagore’s diction making the read a poetic experience. Written with Tagore’s philosophical insight and romantic fervour, The Boat-wreck is an early twentieth-century depiction of love that goes beyond ownership. ­­­­How critics view the book:Gulzar said in a review, \"Tagore picks up the flotsam of a love story from the Ganga and narrates it like only he can. An eternal human story.\"</td>\n",

Interestingly, she is a vegetarian in real life! “It wasn’t easy in the beginning,” she admits. “I couldn’t stand the sight or the smell of raw meat. But I had to do it for the character and finally, I guess I got used to it over time.” In her scenes, she works wearing a messy, stained shirt. “That’s what Anitha looks like while at work. But she appears in normal saris and salwars too,” Sshivada says.All of her portions were shot inside a forest but hey, Sshivada was no rookie at it. “Even my first movie Nedunchalai had a lot of scenes in the forest, so I was kind of used to it. But the days at Bhoothathankettu did offer me some first-time experiences,” she reveals. “I saw a boa for the first time! Everyone on the set kept talking about seeing elephants, about how they once trampled down a set for a temple, and I was wondering why I didn’t see any. On the day of my pack-up, I saw not one, but seven of them right next to my vehicle. It was a family, with elders and the young ones,” she recollects excitedly.Sshivada is also shooting for her Tamil film Iravaakalam, directed by Maya fame Ashwin Saravanan, which also has S J Surya and Wamiqa Gabbi in the lead roles. “My character in it, Madhumita, is a girl who goes around film sets asking for a chance to act. She is quite stylish compared to the characters I have done, and I also have a wider range of emotions to play for her.” Sshivada has been shooting in Chennai and Ootty for the film. The shoot for her next in Malayalam, Chanakyathanthram, in which she plays the CEO of a company, is also going on alongside.  \n",

       "2  The recent call by Bengaluru Mayor Sampath Raj to make kitchen pulverisers mandatory (to reduce solid kitchen waste from going into landfills) has experts seeing red. Kitchen pulverisers — small electric grinder machines installed below kitchen sink that crush any food dumped into it into an almost liquid form — are popular in the West, but activists say that it is just not viable in a city like Bengaluru that lacks the infrastructure that cities in the West do. Therefore, it will only add to our woes.Members of the Bangalore Eco Team recently started a petition online to garner support of Bengalureans and meet the Mayor to show him that the city is not for this form of garbage disposal. “When we met the Mayor earlier about the construction debris issue, he told us about making kitchen pulverisers mandatory for hotels and new houses. We told him then that it’s a bad idea. Our STP (sewerage treatment plant) expert, environment engineer Dr Ananth S Kodavasal, had a couple for meetings with the Mayor and other officials and explained the impact this will have on STPs. Our lakes are already struggling with under capacity STPs, and at this point to introduce another input will clog drains; the city saw flooding in October, all because of clogged drains. We expressed this to the Mayor, but even after that he told the press about making it mandatory. We were about 30-35 activists then, so we thought that we should garner larger support (via the online petition) and get back to him to show that the citizens don’t support this,” says Seema Sharma of the Bangalore Eco Team.The team suggests that there are better and simpler ways of keeping waste out of landfills, such as composting. “If anything needs to be mandated — like Seattle in USA, Havana in Cuba and closer home in Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram — it should be composting on premises. Our city isn’t able to handle sewerage at this point; we can’t add to the load with pulverizing. The BBMP began composting santhes, and, in June, they mooted making composting on premises mandatory, but nothing has been implemented. When we spoke to BWSSB officials, they had no idea about how to take care of crushed food. Pulverisers require a lot of water to drain out the crushed waste — how feasible is that when we are already suffering from water shortage? If we have to copy the West, we need infrastructure like them. When we have good home solutions, such as composting, why ape anyone else? Take a note from Alappuzha, which is among the five cities in the world that are working towards curbing pollution through their sustainable solid waste management practices. They achieved this only by making composting and bio gas mandatory, for which the government provides high subsidies for this. We should be implementing that here,” adds Seema.ADDING TO OUR WOESThe Bangalore Eco Team says that there are many drawbacks to kitchen pulverisers, such as…Waste of fresh water: Each kitchen will need between 10-20 litres of extra fresh water every day to flush down the pulverised food. The city already has acute water shortage.The food will kill STPs: When the crushed food is added to the sewage, its biological oxygen demand will more than double. That means our STPs have to double their capacity overnight. Our STPs are not designed for this load. They will simply fail, and we will have to discharge partially treated sewage to the drains and lakes.The oil and fat content will cause foaming in STPs, kill bacteria: People will pour their used oil and fat in the kitchen sink, which will directly reach the STPs. The fat content will cause a blanket of thick, brown foam on STP tanks, which lowers the efficiency of the bacteria and reduce aeration.The food sludge will block sewerage pipes: Our drainage system is mainly gravity-fed, not pumped. In this type of pipelines, when the sewage flow slows down, it leaves sediments behind. Thus, the sediment builds up gradually and reduces the flow even further. Ultimately it will block the pipe completely.Flooding will get aggravated: Bengaluru sees regular flooding, and when drains are blocked with food sludge, the flooding will increase multifold. When pipes are blocked, the raw sewage will burst out of the manholes and flow freely across the roads.Lakes and drains will be filled with raw sewage and food mix: When STPs belonging to apartments and BWSSB are killed, the raw sewage will reach the drains and lakes. This will kill even those lakes that have recently been rejuvenated.  \n",

As the title suggests, the novel is the story of a boat wreck, and the ensuing catastrophe it brings about in two families. Adorned with evocative language and exquisite depictions of nature, The Boat-Wreck is a moving tale of human lives stuck between the wheels of fortune, and of complicated human relationships.Two wedding parties drown in a boat wreck with the only survivors being one of the bridegrooms Ramesh, and the other party’s bride, Kamala. Kamala and Ramesh, who had not seen their respective partners before their wedding, believe they are married to each other as they try to move on from their recent misfortunes and settle in each other’s company. The story takes a turn as a wonderful romance brews between the couple -- a very meek Kamala and a caring Ramesh. Though he gets to spot the error soon, Ramesh, full of remorse, remains attracted to her. But their cosy world soon collapses as Kamala leaves him the moment she comes to know the truth. A series of adventures take both Kamala and Ramesh to Benaras, where they meet each other again in the most unlikely of circumstances. In a poetic narrative full of charismatic encounters, Tagore weaves a tale of love, fate and emotional upheavals.Tagore has always been known as one of the most farsighted philosophers. Even if some parts of the novel may seem dated, Tagore has portrayed certain nuances of society that are still relevant. Arunava Sinha’s language effortlessly blends with Tagore’s diction making the read a poetic experience. Written with Tagore’s philosophical insight and romantic fervour, The Boat-wreck is an early twentieth-century depiction of love that goes beyond ownership. ­­­­How critics view the book:Gulzar said in a review, \"Tagore picks up the flotsam of a love story from the Ganga and narrates it like only he can. An eternal human story.\"  \n",

       "      <td>Playback singer Maalavika Sundar is an excited woman. After all, the singer has been churning out some hit songs to her credit. Maalavika was known as Carnatic singer, until she broke the tag after she sang the hit number, Dang Dang under D Imman’s composition in Manam Kothi Paravai. Her popularity soared after the release of the song.“After the song, wherever I travelled, people called me ‘Dang Dang Maalavika’. I was scared to sing the folk number in a recording studio as I come from a Carnatic background. But Imman sir made me feel so comfortable. I was completely into Carnatic music until 2010, after which I took part in the singing reality show Super Singer.”Maalavika has sung a number of cine songs, including a few hits like Karuppu Nerathazhagi from Komban, Gum Zaare from Kadavul Irukaan Kumaru. “When I was a part of Super Singer, people used to point out the influence of Carnatic music in my cine songs, but I didn’t realise it then. Now, when I compare what I used to sing to what I am singing now, I can find a huge difference. I am happy with the progress.”So, what kind of preparation does she undergo for Carnatic concert and a cine music concert? “When you are preparing for the former, you have to be quite spontaneous. You have to prepare the different ragams and talams. You need to understand that you will be the only person on stage singing for hours together, which is not the case in cine music concerts. While performing a cine music concert, you have a set track and there isn’t much scope for improvisation.”Maalavika was in the top four of another reality show contest, Indian Idol, this year. “It was the best experience I ever had in my life. It was challenging as I didn’t know the language. In the first audition, there were nearly 20,000 people, but I was directly put into top 24. Meeting different people from different culture, I learnt a lot in few months,” says Maalavika.When quizzed about her online covers, she says, “My first cover was Ey Sandakara from Irudhi Suttru. I had a good producer for the video and it came out really well. I got a lot of appreciation from music directors Imman sir, Santosh Narayanan sir and actor Madhavan as well. Some of the music directors these days do research on YouTube before approaching a singer for recording. Gone are the days where a singer has to produce a demo. A lot of youngsters who don’t have the right opportunity are able to reach music directors today by doing such covers. It hasbecome a huge platform to exhibit your talent.”</td>\n",

But I must say that I am enjoying every bit of it,” says Swathishta, who is presently hosting the show, Compass Countdown on Puthuyugam. “I am generally someone who loves to talk. So, anchoring came naturally to me. And hosting a show only makes you widen your knowledge about several topics,” she says.Talking about the show, Swathishta says, “The show has five segments — cinema updates, celebrity tweets and gossip, viral videos on social media, news on science and technology and a section on sports. Every day, we come up with the most interesting news to give our viewers.” This 30-minute show is telecast every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.Though Swathishta enjoys anchoring, she says she’s looking forward to her film career. “I got a lot of film opportunities after I became an anchor. I am waiting for my films to release and see how my career as an actor shapes up,” she signs off.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Album: Tik Tik Tik Composer: D ImmanThis is D Imman’s 100th album and the man has left no stone unturned to ensure it sounds zesty, peppy and yet, retains his mark of melody. The album opens with the title track, which has everything going for it — powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics and a foot-tapping orchestration. With tik tik tik constantly echoing in the background, Yuvan Shankar Raja and Sunitha Sarathy deliver their punch with a lot of intensity. Add to that Yogi B’s stylish rap and what you have in hand is a formidable number like this. Madhan Karky has once again given us newer Tamil words to mull on — Evvathin nudhigaana yaatru maedhum evvaaru ingae pizhai, pavvathin thulimondu maaganjeyyaadhu vvaanil engae mazhai is just a sample.Imman follows this up with a beautiful melody, Kurumba, a new-age lullaby. The song has a father’s version and a mother’s version, and both are genuinely different, with varying soundscapes and even portions of lyrics, not just the voices. The Father’s Love is sung by Sid Sriram and is more classically inclined, with violin synth strings merging beautifully with intermittent whistling. Mirthula Siva is pitch-perfect in the Mother’s Love version and her fresh voice, westernised rendition and synth-heavy background score gives this number a newer sound. A huge shout out to Karky, for, he’s making us fall in love with Tamil all over again.Next in line is the inspirational Vinveera, and surprisingly for the genre, the energy level in the track sees a dip. Ranjith and Sri Rascol (rap) have rendered the number with all their heart and though it isn’t an ear sore, it somehow doesn’t strike a chord with us. The album has two themes — Race Against Time is crisp, bassy and reflects the mood of the film, while Far Beyond Earth is a little longer and slower. There are karaoke versions of both Tik Tik Tik and Kurumba, and with the lead singers’ voices missing, the two serve their purpose well. In short, Imman’s composition for this space film is quite out of the world.</td>\n",

       "0  Playback singer Maalavika Sundar is an excited woman. After all, the singer has been churning out some hit songs to her credit. Maalavika was known as Carnatic singer, until she broke the tag after she sang the hit number, Dang Dang under D Imman’s composition in Manam Kothi Paravai. Her popularity soared after the release of the song.“After the song, wherever I travelled, people called me ‘Dang Dang Maalavika’. I was scared to sing the folk number in a recording studio as I come from a Carnatic background. But Imman sir made me feel so comfortable. I was completely into Carnatic music until 2010, after which I took part in the singing reality show Super Singer.”Maalavika has sung a number of cine songs, including a few hits like Karuppu Nerathazhagi from Komban, Gum Zaare from Kadavul Irukaan Kumaru. “When I was a part of Super Singer, people used to point out the influence of Carnatic music in my cine songs, but I didn’t realise it then. Now, when I compare what I used to sing to what I am singing now, I can find a huge difference. I am happy with the progress.”So, what kind of preparation does she undergo for Carnatic concert and a cine music concert? “When you are preparing for the former, you have to be quite spontaneous. You have to prepare the different ragams and talams. You need to understand that you will be the only person on stage singing for hours together, which is not the case in cine music concerts. While performing a cine music concert, you have a set track and there isn’t much scope for improvisation.”Maalavika was in the top four of another reality show contest, Indian Idol, this year. “It was the best experience I ever had in my life. It was challenging as I didn’t know the language. In the first audition, there were nearly 20,000 people, but I was directly put into top 24. Meeting different people from different culture, I learnt a lot in few months,” says Maalavika.When quizzed about her online covers, she says, “My first cover was Ey Sandakara from Irudhi Suttru. I had a good producer for the video and it came out really well. I got a lot of appreciation from music directors Imman sir, Santosh Narayanan sir and actor Madhavan as well. Some of the music directors these days do research on YouTube before approaching a singer for recording. Gone are the days where a singer has to produce a demo. A lot of youngsters who don’t have the right opportunity are able to reach music directors today by doing such covers. It hasbecome a huge platform to exhibit your talent.”  \n",

I got the offer after I completed my course. But I must say that I am enjoying every bit of it,” says Swathishta, who is presently hosting the show, Compass Countdown on Puthuyugam. “I am generally someone who loves to talk. So, anchoring came naturally to me. And hosting a show only makes you widen your knowledge about several topics,” she says.Talking about the show, Swathishta says, “The show has five segments — cinema updates, celebrity tweets and gossip, viral videos on social media, news on science and technology and a section on sports.

The album opens with the title track, which has everything going for it — powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics and a foot-tapping orchestration. With tik tik tik constantly echoing in the background, Yuvan Shankar Raja and Sunitha Sarathy deliver their punch with a lot of intensity. Add to that Yogi B’s stylish rap and what you have in hand is a formidable number like this. Madhan Karky has once again given us newer Tamil words to mull on — Evvathin nudhigaana yaatru maedhum evvaaru ingae pizhai, pavvathin thulimondu maaganjeyyaadhu vvaanil engae mazhai is just a sample.Imman follows this up with a beautiful melody, Kurumba, a new-age lullaby. The song has a father’s version and a mother’s version, and both are genuinely different, with varying soundscapes and even portions of lyrics, not just the voices. The Father’s Love is sung by Sid Sriram and is more classically inclined, with violin synth strings merging beautifully with intermittent whistling. Mirthula Siva is pitch-perfect in the Mother’s Love version and her fresh voice, westernised rendition and synth-heavy background score gives this number a newer sound. A huge shout out to Karky, for, he’s making us fall in love with Tamil all over again.Next in line is the inspirational Vinveera, and surprisingly for the genre, the energy level in the track sees a dip. Ranjith and Sri Rascol (rap) have rendered the number with all their heart and though it isn’t an ear sore, it somehow doesn’t strike a chord with us. The album has two themes — Race Against Time is crisp, bassy and reflects the mood of the film, while Far Beyond Earth is a little longer and slower. There are karaoke versions of both Tik Tik Tik and Kurumba, and with the lead singers’ voices missing, the two serve their purpose well. In short, Imman’s composition for this space film is quite out of the world.  "

But probably, there hasn’t been a commercial actress, who’s not taken a sabbatical. But pregnancy is the most normal thing. I was excited about starting a family and I wanted to share my joy with my family, friends and fans. So, there was nothing to hide. Even the fact that I had gained some weight. I put on most of my weight during my last trimester; that was also something I celebrated. Every woman puts on weight and enjoys that period in her life. I’ve also enjoyed hitting the gym and losing weight, which has been rejuvenating in a way. So I’ve just done exactly as I pleased. Having said that, it’s not that I’m setting an example or any such thing.Q. You had no qualms about posting newborn Taimur’s photograph on social media...In today’s times, everyone is seen and is out there. You post pictures on Instagram, on Facebook... because you want to share your life with people.When I was pregnant, both Saif and I had spoken about this and how we’d handle it. He was like there’s nothing to hide. He’s our child and this is the way it’s going to be. He’s going to be photographed, so be it. It’s convenient for stars when they want to be clicked... like at events, while putting on make-up, wearing an outfit... and so on. So, why hide your child? We’re pretty open and clear about it.Q. Taimur Ali Khan’s paparazzi’s favourite…(Laughs) I do understand that. But I just don’t want him to be looked upon as a star-kid. I want him to grow up as normally as possible. I want to let him be just the way he is.Q. Your presence on social media is huge even though you are not on it. When will Kareena Kapoor Khan join the bandwagon?I’m probably more on Instagram than anyone else. My pictures are everywhere. Then I don’t need to constantly be on it, na? My sister (Karisma Kapoor) posts my pictures; my friends put my pictures… My fan clubs have kept me alive. So I don’t have to actively be out there. I guess, Saif and I aren’t cut out for being on social media. Though we’re social.Q. You stepped out for dinner just a couple of days after giving birth, post which there were some unsavoury reactions. Did it bother you?I believe it’s foolish for people to even think in this manner. Giving birth is probably the most normal thing. It’s part of life. I’ve so many friends in America, who give birth and resume work within three days because they have no option. They don’t have a battalion of nurses or nannies looking after their kid.So the concept of having to be at home and sinking into postpartum depression is not required. Even if you’re a breast-feeding mother, you can pump the milk and put it in the feeding bottle for your baby. I don’t want to give any explanations but breast-feeding can be done in different ways.If I stepped out with my husband for an hour that’s also part of the joy of being parents, of being in a happy state of mind to return home to be with your child. Saif and I have never followed norms. And we’re going to be doing what we feel right and convinced about.Q. What kind of a mother are you – chilled or hyper?Since I’m a first time mother, I’m obviously quite hyper. I don’t want to miss out on anything while he’s growing. I wish to be there all the time. I’m loving the journey each day as it unfolds something new. And of course, I’m enjoying being a mother far more than I ever imagined. Being mom to Taimur is probably the most sacred thing in my life. Hope I can be a good one. The journey has just started…Q. Who’s your go-to when it comes to ‘mommy advice’?Actually, I don’t go to anyone. I pretty much want the experience to be my own. You live and learn. Saif tells me please don’t listen to anyone. There are 10 different views and every mother operates differently from the other. So, I listen to everyone but I do my own thing.-By Kinnari Rathod</td>\n",

       "      <td>Did you know that Stanford University’s most popular class isn’t computer science? Nope, that would be a class called ‘Design Your Life’; and it highlights the importance of our personal well-being more than materialistic desires.It’s not the same thing as a New Year resolution. Resolution carries with it a burden that weighs us down. So, let’s begin with the first quarter of 2018 with ‘design’. Author Michael Hyatt who wrote the book, Your Best Year Ever: A 5-Step Plan for Achieving Your Most Important Goals, says all one needs is “the right approach” to design a new year. “Remember your life’s purpose with lower stress, and start designing your future, i.e., knowing how we want all the (specific) variables (of our goals) to fit together in the first place. But don’t be a drifter, be intentional,” says Hyatt, adding that we can only change our future, not our past. And therein lies the beauty of planning/design.GOAL-CENTRIC QUESTIONSAsk yourself: How do you want to feel at the end of 2018? What do you want to see happening at your workfront? How can you fix your health? The more specific the question, the more concrete will be your path to change.Technological enslavement has made sure we live in patterns, i.e., follow the same routine on an everyday basis, and wind up leading a muted, sedated, passive life. Thus, it’s mandatory for us to have a tool box handy to ‘design’ our lives. Life coach and author of Life Is a Do-Over: You Can Choose a New Path in Life, Cindy Clemens, urges us all to wake up from our ‘autopilot mode’. “Begin by creating your life compass, it will give a specific direction to your life. Make a focus list. Be curious and passionate,” she says. It’s the same point author Jen Sincero makes in her book, You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life. She says, “If you want to live a life you’ve never lived, you have to do things you’ve never done.”EASY-TO-APPLY CHANGESSays Archana Sardana, skydiver and mountaineer, “A life plan has to be implemented with easy experiments, where you are ‘doing’ the stuff on the blueprint of your goals. Experimentation is critical.”Clemens asks people to find the sweet spot between creating a great life and actually being present for these delicious moments of your life. A regular journalling practice can be a great way observe and process this creation. “I love to find a great place to go to and journal, be it the local coffee house, a park bench, or even a short walk in nature. I spend about 15 minutes reflecting on what has been showing up in my life and what steps I took,” she explains.INVEST IN 'SUPER CARE' NOT CARAuthor Rolf Dobelli, who wrote The Art of the Good Life, explains, “Every now and then, your life could be upturned. And there’s always a silent revolution that takes place within fields of thought. That’s why we need a mental toolkit from which we can draw different tools every now and then to move forward.” He urges people to “invest in building a mental fortress, not a Porsche collection, or, invest in super care, not supercar”. And while at it, identify the tasks that suck your energies like daily commute, paying bills etc. and experiment with ways to minimise their impact on your moods. Once undue stresses are removed from life, it’s easier to look at long-term goals that are achievable.How can you DESIGN 2018?- Discover WHY you want your year to be powerful: The power of your WHY is what motivates you through the gruelling, mundane and laborious tasks. All the ‘hows’ in life will be meaningless until your ‘whys’ are powerful enough.- Here’s the secret of goal-setting. You only see, experience and get what you look for. If you don’t know what to look for, you certainly won’t get it.- When you define your goals, you give your brain something to focus on and look for. You give your mind a new set of eyes to see all the people, circumstances, conversations, resources and ideas. It automatically broadens your horizons.- Expectation manifests into creation, i.e., it is what we expect that determines what we create in our lives.- Don’t just THINK it – INK it: The weakest ink is stronger than the strongest mind. Unless you write down your goals, they are often lost in the shuffle and excitement of new problems.- Start living with audacity. Have chutzpah. Stand away from the crowd. Don’t follow the herd any longer.Source: Darren Hardy,Living Your Best Year Ever- Post less stuff on social media- Focus on your inner scorecard, not outer.- Don’t believe in your own self-importance. This is one of the most valuable strategies for a good life.Source: Rolf Dobelli,The Art Of the Good LifeEvery year, my blueprint of what I want to do changes. From writing, I moved to working creatively with food. While designing your life, keep things simple and be in pursuit of calming pleasures that contribute to peace of mind— Sadia Dehlvi, author, food connoisseurRachel Roy, fashion designer and author of 'Design Your Life: Creating Success Through Personal Style', says what she chooses to wear affects not just her self-esteem but also the energy she puts out into the Universe.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Complex and contemplative in equal parts, ultra violet is often associated with mindfulness practices. A reason why you are likely to spot purple-toned lighting in meditative spaces. The colour is said to fill people with energy and positivity and inspire connection. Why not embrace the hue to bring some happiness and tranquility into your home?UV waysDecor expert Astha Khetan says that ultra violet adds a certain depth to a space. Whether you are using a statement pillow, painting, accent wall, a few sprigs of lilac or a vintage rug – a simple touch of the magical hue is all you need to transform your space. Her advice: “The easiest way to start decorating with a new colour is to take baby steps and not go overboard.”Ultra violet, with its bold and vivid blue, is a perfect match with raw materials such as concrete and natural wood. For statement corners, try ultra violet in different combinations; with sage green, lemon yellow, or vermillion. “In small spaces, avoid using ultra violet vertically like in curtains and walls. Use in small accessories on floor and below eye level,” suggests decor expert Vaishnavi Pratima. In large spaces, experiment with walls in ultra violet juxtaposed against contrasting furniture.— Additional inputs from decor expert Anuja JoshiHow to go UV?Pick jewel tones for a strong visual punch.

You carried your pregnancy with élan and seemed to enjoy every bit of it...(Smiles) I’m sure a lot of models and actors in our country — and in the West — have done this as well. But probably, there hasn’t been a commercial actress, who’s not taken a sabbatical. But pregnancy is the most normal thing. I was excited about starting a family and I wanted to share my joy with my family, friends and fans. So, there was nothing to hide. Even the fact that I had gained some weight. I put on most of my weight during my last trimester; that was also something I celebrated. Every woman puts on weight and enjoys that period in her life. I’ve also enjoyed hitting the gym and losing weight, which has been rejuvenating in a way. So I’ve just done exactly as I pleased. Having said that, it’s not that I’m setting an example or any such thing.Q. You had no qualms about posting newborn Taimur’s photograph on social media...In today’s times, everyone is seen and is out there. You post pictures on Instagram, on Facebook... because you want to share your life with people.When I was pregnant, both Saif and I had spoken about this and how we’d handle it. He was like there’s nothing to hide. He’s our child and this is the way it’s going to be. He’s going to be photographed, so be it. It’s convenient for stars when they want to be clicked... like at events, while putting on make-up, wearing an outfit... and so on. So, why hide your child? We’re pretty open and clear about it.Q. Taimur Ali Khan’s paparazzi’s favourite…(Laughs) I do understand that. But I just don’t want him to be looked upon as a star-kid. I want him to grow up as normally as possible. I want to let him be just the way he is.Q. Your presence on social media is huge even though you are not on it. When will Kareena Kapoor Khan join the bandwagon?I’m probably more on Instagram than anyone else. My pictures are everywhere. Then I don’t need to constantly be on it, na? My sister (Karisma Kapoor) posts my pictures; my friends put my pictures… My fan clubs have kept me alive. So I don’t have to actively be out there. I guess, Saif and I aren’t cut out for being on social media. Though we’re social.Q. You stepped out for dinner just a couple of days after giving birth, post which there were some unsavoury reactions. Did it bother you?I believe it’s foolish for people to even think in this manner. Giving birth is probably the most normal thing. It’s part of life. I’ve so many friends in America, who give birth and resume work within three days because they have no option. They don’t have a battalion of nurses or nannies looking after their kid.So the concept of having to be at home and sinking into postpartum depression is not required. Even if you’re a breast-feeding mother, you can pump the milk and put it in the feeding bottle for your baby. I don’t want to give any explanations but breast-feeding can be done in different ways.If I stepped out with my husband for an hour that’s also part of the joy of being parents, of being in a happy state of mind to return home to be with your child. Saif and I have never followed norms. And we’re going to be doing what we feel right and convinced about.Q. What kind of a mother are you – chilled or hyper?Since I’m a first time mother, I’m obviously quite hyper. I don’t want to miss out on anything while he’s growing. I wish to be there all the time. I’m loving the journey each day as it unfolds something new. And of course, I’m enjoying being a mother far more than I ever imagined. Being mom to Taimur is probably the most sacred thing in my life. Hope I can be a good one. The journey has just started…Q. Who’s your go-to when it comes to ‘mommy advice’?Actually, I don’t go to anyone. I pretty much want the experience to be my own. You live and learn. Saif tells me please don’t listen to anyone. There are 10 different views and every mother operates differently from the other. So, I listen to everyone but I do my own thing.-By Kinnari Rathod  \n",

       "2  Did you know that Stanford University’s most popular class isn’t computer science? Nope, that would be a class called ‘Design Your Life’; and it highlights the importance of our personal well-being more than materialistic desires.It’s not the same thing as a New Year resolution. Resolution carries with it a burden that weighs us down. So, let’s begin with the first quarter of 2018 with ‘design’. Author Michael Hyatt who wrote the book, Your Best Year Ever: A 5-Step Plan for Achieving Your Most Important Goals, says all one needs is “the right approach” to design a new year. “Remember your life’s purpose with lower stress, and start designing your future, i.e., knowing how we want all the (specific) variables (of our goals) to fit together in the first place. But don’t be a drifter, be intentional,” says Hyatt, adding that we can only change our future, not our past. And therein lies the beauty of planning/design.GOAL-CENTRIC QUESTIONSAsk yourself: How do you want to feel at the end of 2018? What do you want to see happening at your workfront? How can you fix your health? The more specific the question, the more concrete will be your path to change.Technological enslavement has made sure we live in patterns, i.e., follow the same routine on an everyday basis, and wind up leading a muted, sedated, passive life. Thus, it’s mandatory for us to have a tool box handy to ‘design’ our lives. Life coach and author of Life Is a Do-Over: You Can Choose a New Path in Life, Cindy Clemens, urges us all to wake up from our ‘autopilot mode’. “Begin by creating your life compass, it will give a specific direction to your life. Make a focus list. Be curious and passionate,” she says. It’s the same point author Jen Sincero makes in her book, You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life. She says, “If you want to live a life you’ve never lived, you have to do things you’ve never done.”EASY-TO-APPLY CHANGESSays Archana Sardana, skydiver and mountaineer, “A life plan has to be implemented with easy experiments, where you are ‘doing’ the stuff on the blueprint of your goals. Experimentation is critical.”Clemens asks people to find the sweet spot between creating a great life and actually being present for these delicious moments of your life. A regular journalling practice can be a great way observe and process this creation. “I love to find a great place to go to and journal, be it the local coffee house, a park bench, or even a short walk in nature. I spend about 15 minutes reflecting on what has been showing up in my life and what steps I took,” she explains.INVEST IN 'SUPER CARE' NOT CARAuthor Rolf Dobelli, who wrote The Art of the Good Life, explains, “Every now and then, your life could be upturned. And there’s always a silent revolution that takes place within fields of thought. That’s why we need a mental toolkit from which we can draw different tools every now and then to move forward.” He urges people to “invest in building a mental fortress, not a Porsche collection, or, invest in super care, not supercar”. And while at it, identify the tasks that suck your energies like daily commute, paying bills etc. and experiment with ways to minimise their impact on your moods. Once undue stresses are removed from life, it’s easier to look at long-term goals that are achievable.How can you DESIGN 2018?- Discover WHY you want your year to be powerful: The power of your WHY is what motivates you through the gruelling, mundane and laborious tasks. All the ‘hows’ in life will be meaningless until your ‘whys’ are powerful enough.- Here’s the secret of goal-setting. You only see, experience and get what you look for. If you don’t know what to look for, you certainly won’t get it.- When you define your goals, you give your brain something to focus on and look for. You give your mind a new set of eyes to see all the people, circumstances, conversations, resources and ideas. It automatically broadens your horizons.- Expectation manifests into creation, i.e., it is what we expect that determines what we create in our lives.- Don’t just THINK it – INK it: The weakest ink is stronger than the strongest mind. Unless you write down your goals, they are often lost in the shuffle and excitement of new problems.- Start living with audacity. Have chutzpah. Stand away from the crowd. Don’t follow the herd any longer.Source: Darren Hardy,Living Your Best Year Ever- Post less stuff on social media- Focus on your inner scorecard, not outer.- Don’t believe in your own self-importance. This is one of the most valuable strategies for a good life.Source: Rolf Dobelli,The Art Of the Good LifeEvery year, my blueprint of what I want to do changes. From writing, I moved to working creatively with food. While designing your life, keep things simple and be in pursuit of calming pleasures that contribute to peace of mind— Sadia Dehlvi, author, food connoisseurRachel Roy, fashion designer and author of 'Design Your Life: Creating Success Through Personal Style', says what she chooses to wear affects not just her self-esteem but also the energy she puts out into the Universe.  \n",

A reason why you are likely to spot purple-toned lighting in meditative spaces. The colour is said to fill people with energy and positivity and inspire connection. Why not embrace the hue to bring some happiness and tranquility into your home?UV waysDecor expert Astha Khetan says that ultra violet adds a certain depth to a space. Whether you are using a statement pillow, painting, accent wall, a few sprigs of lilac or a vintage rug – a simple touch of the magical hue is all you need to transform your space. Her advice: “The easiest way to start decorating with a new colour is to take baby steps and not go overboard.”Ultra violet, with its bold and vivid blue, is a perfect match with raw materials such as concrete and natural wood. For statement corners, try ultra violet in different combinations; with sage green, lemon yellow, or vermillion. “In small spaces, avoid using ultra violet vertically like in curtains and walls. Use in small accessories on floor and below eye level,” suggests decor expert Vaishnavi Pratima. In large spaces, experiment with walls in ultra violet juxtaposed against contrasting furniture.— Additional inputs from decor expert Anuja JoshiHow to go UV?Pick jewel tones for a strong visual punch. But the idea is to make an impact without being garishMake sure your colours stay sophisticated by choosing shades from the same family that are not all too brightMix dark and romantic purple with other super-saturated dark colours and rich fabrics like velvetUse flowers like pansies, iris, phlox, hydrangea, petunia, verbenas, freesia, and columbinUse vases made in violet assortmentA tricky hue for homes, if you play it right UV can be the pop of colour that your house needs.Violet can be used in dining couture too. Think a white table with UV napkins.Bring in violet accessories like candle stands, lampshades, vases to add a splash of colour  "

His passion for travel, music and books is amazing and as we talk, I am sure he might be scaling the Himalayas or enjoying the peace at Manasarovar,” says Sijoy.The actor is also all praise for Pranav’s simplicity. “Maybe it’s because we are aware of the stature he enjoys in the industry in spite of which he remains a down-to-earth personality,” he says.Charlie, the character played by Dulquer in the eponymous movie, isn’t the only similarity that Sijoy found in the two star kids. “I was also impressed watching Pranav pull-off daring stunts sans dupe, just like how Dulquer took up bike stunts all by himself in Bangalore Days,” he says. “Also, on the sets, you would always see Pranav playing a guitar and singing.”Sijoy, who was also part of Kunchacko Boban’s latest release and Aadu 2, plays a well-to-do businessman named Sidharth in Aadhi. “He is quite shrewd and is based out of Bengaluru. As opposed to the usual salt and pepper look, I will be sporting jet-black hair in the film,” he reveals.The actor is also part of Mammootty’s Parole, directed by Sharrath Sandith. “I play Mammootty’s brother-in-law, a Pala-based achayan,” he says. Sijoy is also debuting in Telugu soon and hints it would be in a major project featuring a superstar. “I play an underworld don in the film and it feels great to try yet another industry, after Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi. I hope that I enjoy Telugu as much as I do the other three languages,” signs off Sijoy.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Fire broke out in the wee hours of Monday morning at a city bar in Kalasipalya, which claimed the lives of five employees who were asleep at the premises. While the cause of the blaze and other details are being investigated, the incident raises concern over safety precautions that Bengaluru bars adopt. In the process of quick business and lucrative incentives, many restaurants, cafés and bars offer their premises as makeshift sleeping areas for their staff. Given that the kitchens have inflammable equipment along with alcohol as well, this makes one wonder whether the problem is more than what meets the eye.Former local National Restaurant Association of India head and restaurateur Ashish Kothare cites rule 13 from The Karnataka Excise License (General Conditions) Rules 1967. “It states, ‘the licensee shall not allow any person other than a member of his family or his authorized servant in the shop during nights after the time fixed for closing the shop’. It clearly states that one cannot make their staff stay in these establishments daily, unless there is some work required,” says Ashish.An industry expert and restaurateur, on the basis of anonymyity, tells us, “While there is the obvious flouting of rules, there is another angle that needs to be considered. This has happened in an area like Kalasipalya and these bars and restaurants there are open usually at unearthly hours to cater to the labour class. These daily wage labourers, who wait there in the hope of being picked up by contractors, drink a lot to get themselves in the frame of mind to do the mammoth work they are subjected to. Most of these venues do their best business between 5 am and 7 am, when the labourers want to drink before their day begins. This is something that needs to be looked into as well.”Two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized: NRAIRahul Singh, President, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), says, “Members of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) adhere to the fire norms and timelines as prescribed by the state or city. The last shift crew follows the closing check list which constitutes stock take, clean up, prepare tables for next day, sequential shut down of equipment, checking the fire panel, among others. The restaurant is then locked up. Sleeping in the premises is not permitted. Restaurants, by their essentiality of open flames in kitchen, hot equipment, electrical connections, cooking oils, cleaning chemicals, paper product and furniture, have all the ingredients for a fire to flame out of control. Fire protection deals with prevention, while fire fighting deals with cure in case of fire. Poor fire protection leads to necessity of fire fighting service. One cannot exist without the other. Unfortunately, two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized and susceptible to flouting norms, whichtarnishes the image of the entire sector.”BBMP’s pre-emptive act in 2018Last week, in wake of the Mumbai fire incident at a buzzing hotspot that claimed lives, the BBMP issued notices to over 60 spaces, which mainlyincluded rooftop arenas, citing violation of fire safety norms.

       "      <td>Actors across the world have shown a penchant for being in the public eye and ‘serving society’ by running for office. In India, especially in the South, has also been at the forefront of it, with most states having been run by an erstwhile actor as Chief Minister. So, it is not surprising if your favourite star joins a popular party, or launches his/her own, as has been the case in recent times with Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Upendra. We asked the youth, the backbone of the country, if being in showbiz qualifies actors to work for society...FORActors should be encouraged to venture into fields like politics. The nature of their work and lifestyle could mean that they remain unaware of everyday realities in different parts of the country, but the influence and reach of these personalities must be kept in mind. As people who have unwavering support and loyalty among fans, it is imperative to understand that the positive policies undertaken by actors will definitely be beneficial in the long run because of public backing — Saurav K, 2nd year, BBA, CMS Jain UniversityActors are, at the end of the day, ordinary people like us and should be allowed to explore whatever avenues they wish. As long as their intentions are right and just, politics is a great option for actors. They make great role models and they already have huge fan bases, which is sure to make them successful public figures in the political sphere. If they can make good use of their position and power, society will greatly benefit from their endeavours. As long as they take measured and responsible decisions, actors will make great politicians — Gokul V, student of Chartered Accountancy, JK Shaw InstituteAn actor will definitely know how to ‘act’, be it onscreen or off it . Mixing these two seemingly ominous fields could lead to a better India. Actors are used to the limelight, and they probably could, all things considered, handle the pressure better. I’d say act-ions speak louder than words — Aparajit Radhakrishna, 4th semester, Media Studies, Christ UniversityAGAINSTMovie stars live in a world of make-believe, where they sell dreams to masses. Unfortunately, the cult of hero-worshipping and fandom distances them from ground realities over a period of time. They lack the required organizational and administrative skills to be effective in public administration. They should avoid getting into the world of politics for these reasons — Oorvi Umesh, 2nd year, MES College of Arts, Commerce and ScienceNo, they should not, because actors live in their own bubble and may not really understand the day-to-day problems people. They may find it hard to connect with the lower strata of society and, hence, cannot be a voice for them. Also, a large part of their following would just go with anything they say because of their celebrity status; I’m not sure how many people would oppose their favourite star, if the need be. It is, after all, an important part of any democratic process — Vidya Viswanathan, 3rd year, Home Science, Mount Carmel CollegePoliticians might make good actors, but actors do not always make good politicians. The elections become a popularity contest instead of a decision-making process for citizens to elect the most deserving candidate who might not be as well known. In reality, actors are not always equipped with the knowledge or experience to hold a position of authority — Kallam Sashikala, 1st year, BA PYEE, Mount Carmel College-- Sanjana Sindhe</td>\n",

       "      <td>With their hearts beating faster, prayers on their lips and anxious looks on their faces, the students wait with bated breath for the results of their competitions, after showcasing their best; all the while, preparing themselves to face both failure and success.Once the results are announced, for the winners, there is a sudden rush of emotions – of joy and relief – as they rejoice with their family and friends. Flashes of camera and interviews follow. And for those who don’t make it to the top three, the platform becomes the best teacher for life as they accept failure saying that not everyone gets a prize and they should focus on the next task.Over the past five decades, the Kerala State Youth festival, the cultural extravaganza touted as Asia’s largest youth festival, has been a place where you saw tears of joy and disappointment under one roof. However, this aspect has been sorely missing at the ongoing edition at Thrissur, which has scrapped the practice of awarding first, second and third prizes and adopted a grading system with all participants being awarded a trophy.Though the organisers say that the decision was to curtail unhealthy competition, it has created a bigger mess, according to the participants, parents, teachers and previous years’ winners. The lukewarm response and disappointed faces of teachers and parents reflect the mood at the venues as they say that they are sure that their children will get an A grade anyway.Alappuzha resident Salahuddin Y, father of Asna S T, who earned an A grade for Ghazal, calls the grading system “an injustice to the kids”. “It will only make the mediocre and below average participants happy, and spoil the thrill of the festival. Though the idea that art is not for competition sounds nice, I strongly feel that the children should be given recognition by ranking first, second and third. I am an employee at the Public Service Commission Department and we cannot offer jobs to everyone who has applied. This is like the Malayalam proverb eliye pedichu illam chuduka.”The students are being the victims of the inefficiency of the system, fumes Silvastar MJ, a drawing teacher from Wayanad, whose students have been consistently winning at the festival for the past 18 years. He says that the grading system will only help the judges avoid attacks of parents and teachers.Silvastar adds, “The government has done a favour, especially to those who judge dance competitions. The judges would give everyone an A grade now and avoid chaos. We saw it happen with the Kathakali contest, where 11 out of the 12 teams got an A grade,” he says. “Now it isn’t a competition venue but just a platform to exhibit. However, even at exhibitions, there are prizes for the best stalls.”The youth festival has a history of discovering many talents such as Manju Warrier, Kavya Madhavan, G Venugopal, Sujatha, Navya Nair and Vineeth, who were the cream of the contestants.Salahuddin says that these opportunities will be denied to the students due to the revised system. “If our earlier system was faulty, how did we get amazing artistes from it? No matter how talented the students are, there will always be one or two who stand out. There were 18 A grades in higher secondary girls’ light music contest. What is the point of the competition now?” he asks.Supporting him, actress Ambili Devi, who won seven prizes at the 2001 fest, says, “I am not against grades as there will be many talents apart from the best three. Let them give an A grade to them but the best should be acknowledged. It is like you contest strongly at the school and district levels and then at the state level, everyone is considered equal. The government has probably adopted this to reduce appeals and other discrepancies, but I think those aspects shouldn’t come in the way of the spirit of youth festival.”The new system also deprives students the ability to handle failure, says 1996’s Kalaprathiba Dr Sreehari G K. “In every competition, there will be a best performer like in a marathon or a 100 metre race. The basic intention of a competition is to give the children an idea of success and failure and prepare them to face the future. In our time, we never felt those won were greater than those who didn’t as there was always a healthy competition, mutual respect and acceptance. Now in the name of stress, we are creating a lethargic generation who is incapable of handling minute stress,” he says.According to Silvastar, the stress and discrepancies are more prevalent at the lower levels. “A lot of politics happen at school levels and children are pressurised and even emotionally hurt. If it is about creating healthy competitions, the government should first monitor selection process of the youth festival at these levels,” he explains.Former winner and engineering student Amrutha S, from Palakad who has accompanied her sister Gopika for this year’s event, says the grading system takes away the charm of the fest. “I lost all interest the moment I heard about the revised manual,” she says. “There should be a winner. Only those who have been part of the previous fests and have won or lost will know the beauty of it. It is not just nostalgia, it was our first step to face the bigger world outside.”Echoing her views is BDS student Megha Muraleedaran from Malappuram who has also returned to the festival ground with good memories about late night competitions and camaraderie. “The standards may come down as the participants are aware that an average performance would fetch them an A grade. They may seem relaxed but I feel we will lose out on all the fun. What is a youth festival without winners? They have already removed Kalathilakam and Kalaprathiba title, now this too,” says Megha, who accompanied her sister, who participated in the Kathakali competition.However, there are a few who support the new system. Singer Vaishnav Girish, who earned two A grades in Ghazal and Urdu group song, says he believes the festival is just another stage performance. “I do not think we should look at it as competition. That is what my mother says. She tells me to go, enjoy and return. I think the grading system will make everyone happy,” he says.Agreeing with him, dancer teacher and actor Ramadevi says, “This will make the festival scam-free. We all know that a lot of corruption has been happening behind the scenes and most of the time the prizes didn’t go to those who deserved it. That will all change and the festival will become a creative fiesta.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Kathakali is child’s play for Vishrutha</td>\n",
       "      <td>She is all of nine years old, but get her started on Kathakali and a young Vishrutha Vijayakumar speaks like a learned person with many years of experience.And indeed, the little girl has some solid experience in her kitty as an emerging young talent of the art form. The artiste from North Paravoor, who is a Class 4 student in Aura Global School, Kodungalloor, has performed Kathakali in more than 60 stages so far, and has even portrayed roles like Mathali of Kalakeyavadham, which are only done by experienced artistes.To have a profile like that, she did start very young. “I was introduced to Kathakali when I was in kindergarten and I remember those days in bits and pieces,” she says, adding, “My parents sent me to Kathakali class saying, ‘Why don’t you try it? If you like it, you can learn it.’ When I watched it, the colours, music and mudras appeared to be a lot of fun.”It was under her first guru Sathi Sreekumar that Vishrutha learned the basics of the art, vaithari, kaal sadhakam et al. She staged her arangettam when she was in Class 2 and over the years, she says, her love for the art form grew manifold as she learned more. “The various stories and aspects of Kathakali fascinate me every time I learn something new. My current guru, FACT Biju Bhaskar, is the one who taught me the stories of the art form,” she says. Vishrutha has portrayed a variety of characters like Krishnan, Prahladan and more, but wants to do more of kathi veshams.“I am now learning the young Ravanan’s character in Ravanotbhavam,” Vishrutha says, adding that playing Mathali was another memorable experience. “I don’t think anyone my age has previously performed Mathali on stage. It’s done by senior artistes, and that gives me immense pride.”On her favourite performers of the art form, she says, “Kalamandalam Gopi aasan used to be my favourite till some time ago. Now, I like my guruji’s performances better because his veshabhangi is incomparable and kathi veshams are superb. When he plays women characters, for instance, you wouldn’t know the difference, despite him being a man. I too want to try out some female roles soon, like those in Duryodhanavadham,” Vishrutha says.The young artiste’s talent isn’t limited to Kathakali alone but also finds time to learn Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam and Kuchipudi under R L V Unnikrishnan, Dr Neena Prasad and Sreelakshmi Govardhan, respectively. How easy is it for her to manage school, along with all of these trainings? “We have a lot to study at school too. Sometimes, I study from 7 pm to 12 pm, especially during examination times, to compensate for lost hours,” she exclaims.However, Vishrutha is yet to showcase Kathakali at school. “I have only performed dance at school. My friends never recognise me in my Kathakali make-up, when they see photographs or programmes. ‘Is that really you, Vishrutha?’ they ask me. I don’t think even an ounce of my casual look gets retained when I put on the Kathakali make-up,” she says.Of late, Vishrutha has also stepped into the world of cinema. She is part of a children’s film titled Papas, directed by Sampath. “I play a character named Meenu in the film, who lived around 1984. She is nine years old and is the girlfriend of the lead character,” Vishrutha says.Will she continue with Kathakali when she grows up? “My dream is to be an established Kathakali artiste. At times, my mom says in jest why not become a doctor, but I guess my parents also want me to be an artiste,” she says.Vishrutha’s parents, Vijayakumar and Sindhu, are settled in North Paravoor. Her mom Sindhu says, “We didn’t get her interested in these art forms for anything else, but to make her a good artiste. However, she is too young to figure it all out now. If she grows up and decides to be a meritorious artiste, we would consider that a great achievement.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>One of the major announcements this week was undoubtedly Chiyaan Vikram playing the role of Karna in Ennu Ninte Moideen director RS Vimal’s upcoming film, Mahavir Karna, which is touted to be made on a budget of Rs 300 crore.While Vimal had earlier announced the movie with Prithviraj, he says that the team changed their plans midway and opted for Vikram.“Prithviraj is busy with his directorial Lucifer and has other acting commitments for the next two years. By mid 2017, we had decided to scale up the project to an international level and had apprised Prithviraj of roping in Vikram. He was completely fine with it,” says Vimal.However, the Ennu Ninte Moideen director says that Vikram had his doubts when he had initially approached him for the movie based on the character in Mahabharatha.“When I first contacted him on phone, Vikram was sceptical. That’s because in Tamil, Sivaji Ganesan had played Karnan and in Telugu there was an epic film by NT Rama Rao titled Daana Veera Soora Karna. So, he wanted to know how this film was going to be different,” he says.This prompted the director to meet the actor in person and narrate the screenplay, which he has been working for the past three years.“Once he heard the script narration and understood the in-depth research for it, he was convinced. Also, we will be using cutting edge technology to recreate this period,” says Vimal.Apart from Vikram, the movie will have several stars from different film industries with “major Hollywood actor playing Bhima,” says Vimal, adding that Dangal’s casting director Mukesh Chhabra is also part of the movie.While Vikram is no stranger to transforming his body to suit the character, this film too will have him pushing his limits to play the warrior. “He has already started working out and will be trained by international action choreographers abroad for the war sequences of the film,” says the filmmaker.Mahavir Karna, which will be made in Hindi and released in other languages, will go on floors in October 2018 and is expected to release by December 2019. The movie will be shot in Niagara waterfalls in Canada, Hyderabad and Jaipur.</td>\n",

While the cause of the blaze and other details are being investigated, the incident raises concern over safety precautions that Bengaluru bars adopt. In the process of quick business and lucrative incentives, many restaurants, cafés and bars offer their premises as makeshift sleeping areas for their staff. Given that the kitchens have inflammable equipment along with alcohol as well, this makes one wonder whether the problem is more than what meets the eye.Former local National Restaurant Association of India head and restaurateur Ashish Kothare cites rule 13 from The Karnataka Excise License (General Conditions) Rules 1967. “It states, ‘the licensee shall not allow any person other than a member of his family or his authorized servant in the shop during nights after the time fixed for closing the shop’. It clearly states that one cannot make their staff stay in these establishments daily, unless there is some work required,” says Ashish.An industry expert and restaurateur, on the basis of anonymyity, tells us, “While there is the obvious flouting of rules, there is another angle that needs to be considered. This has happened in an area like Kalasipalya and these bars and restaurants there are open usually at unearthly hours to cater to the labour class. These daily wage labourers, who wait there in the hope of being picked up by contractors, drink a lot to get themselves in the frame of mind to do the mammoth work they are subjected to. Most of these venues do their best business between 5 am and 7 am, when the labourers want to drink before their day begins. This is something that needs to be looked into as well.”Two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized: NRAIRahul Singh, President, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), says, “Members of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) adhere to the fire norms and timelines as prescribed by the state or city. The last shift crew follows the closing check list which constitutes stock take, clean up, prepare tables for next day, sequential shut down of equipment, checking the fire panel, among others. The restaurant is then locked up. Sleeping in the premises is not permitted. Restaurants, by their essentiality of open flames in kitchen, hot equipment, electrical connections, cooking oils, cleaning chemicals, paper product and furniture, have all the ingredients for a fire to flame out of control. Fire protection deals with prevention, while fire fighting deals with cure in case of fire. Poor fire protection leads to necessity of fire fighting service. One cannot exist without the other. Unfortunately, two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized and susceptible to flouting norms, whichtarnishes the image of the entire sector.”BBMP’s pre-emptive act in 2018Last week, in wake of the Mumbai fire incident at a buzzing hotspot that claimed lives, the BBMP issued notices to over 60 spaces, which mainlyincluded rooftop arenas, citing violation of fire safety norms.

In India, especially in the South, has also been at the forefront of it, with most states having been run by an erstwhile actor as Chief Minister. So, it is not surprising if your favourite star joins a popular party, or launches his/her own, as has been the case in recent times with Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Upendra. We asked the youth, the backbone of the country, if being in showbiz qualifies actors to work for society...FORActors should be encouraged to venture into fields like politics. The nature of their work and lifestyle could mean that they remain unaware of everyday realities in different parts of the country, but the influence and reach of these personalities must be kept in mind. As people who have unwavering support and loyalty among fans, it is imperative to understand that the positive policies undertaken by actors will definitely be beneficial in the long run because of public backing — Saurav K, 2nd year, BBA, CMS Jain UniversityActors are, at the end of the day, ordinary people like us and should be allowed to explore whatever avenues they wish. As long as their intentions are right and just, politics is a great option for actors. They make great role models and they already have huge fan bases, which is sure to make them successful public figures in the political sphere. If they can make good use of their position and power, society will greatly benefit from their endeavours. As long as they take measured and responsible decisions, actors will make great politicians — Gokul V, student of Chartered Accountancy, JK Shaw InstituteAn actor will definitely know how to ‘act’, be it onscreen or off it . Mixing these two seemingly ominous fields could lead to a better India. Actors are used to the limelight, and they probably could, all things considered, handle the pressure better. I’d say act-ions speak louder than words — Aparajit Radhakrishna, 4th semester, Media Studies, Christ UniversityAGAINSTMovie stars live in a world of make-believe, where they sell dreams to masses. Unfortunately, the cult of hero-worshipping and fandom distances them from ground realities over a period of time. They lack the required organizational and administrative skills to be effective in public administration. They should avoid getting into the world of politics for these reasons — Oorvi Umesh, 2nd year, MES College of Arts, Commerce and ScienceNo, they should not, because actors live in their own bubble and may not really understand the day-to-day problems people. They may find it hard to connect with the lower strata of society and, hence, cannot be a voice for them. Also, a large part of their following would just go with anything they say because of their celebrity status; I’m not sure how many people would oppose their favourite star, if the need be. It is, after all, an important part of any democratic process — Vidya Viswanathan, 3rd year, Home Science, Mount Carmel CollegePoliticians might make good actors, but actors do not always make good politicians. The elections become a popularity contest instead of a decision-making process for citizens to elect the most deserving candidate who might not be as well known. In reality, actors are not always equipped with the knowledge or experience to hold a position of authority — Kallam Sashikala, 1st year, BA PYEE, Mount Carmel College-- Sanjana Sindhe  \n",
       "2  With their hearts beating faster, prayers on their lips and anxious looks on their faces, the students wait with bated breath for the results of their competitions, after showcasing their best; all the while, preparing themselves to face both failure and success.Once the results are announced, for the winners, there is a sudden rush of emotions – of joy and relief – as they rejoice with their family and friends. Flashes of camera and interviews follow. And for those who don’t make it to the top three, the platform becomes the best teacher for life as they accept failure saying that not everyone gets a prize and they should focus on the next task.Over the past five decades, the Kerala State Youth festival, the cultural extravaganza touted as Asia’s largest youth festival, has been a place where you saw tears of joy and disappointment under one roof. However, this aspect has been sorely missing at the ongoing edition at Thrissur, which has scrapped the practice of awarding first, second and third prizes and adopted a grading system with all participants being awarded a trophy.Though the organisers say that the decision was to curtail unhealthy competition, it has created a bigger mess, according to the participants, parents, teachers and previous years’ winners. The lukewarm response and disappointed faces of teachers and parents reflect the mood at the venues as they say that they are sure that their children will get an A grade anyway.Alappuzha resident Salahuddin Y, father of Asna S T, who earned an A grade for Ghazal, calls the grading system “an injustice to the kids”. “It will only make the mediocre and below average participants happy, and spoil the thrill of the festival. Though the idea that art is not for competition sounds nice, I strongly feel that the children should be given recognition by ranking first, second and third. I am an employee at the Public Service Commission Department and we cannot offer jobs to everyone who has applied. This is like the Malayalam proverb eliye pedichu illam chuduka.”The students are being the victims of the inefficiency of the system, fumes Silvastar MJ, a drawing teacher from Wayanad, whose students have been consistently winning at the festival for the past 18 years. He says that the grading system will only help the judges avoid attacks of parents and teachers.Silvastar adds, “The government has done a favour, especially to those who judge dance competitions. The judges would give everyone an A grade now and avoid chaos. We saw it happen with the Kathakali contest, where 11 out of the 12 teams got an A grade,” he says. “Now it isn’t a competition venue but just a platform to exhibit. However, even at exhibitions, there are prizes for the best stalls.”The youth festival has a history of discovering many talents such as Manju Warrier, Kavya Madhavan, G Venugopal, Sujatha, Navya Nair and Vineeth, who were the cream of the contestants.Salahuddin says that these opportunities will be denied to the students due to the revised system. “If our earlier system was faulty, how did we get amazing artistes from it? No matter how talented the students are, there will always be one or two who stand out. There were 18 A grades in higher secondary girls’ light music contest. What is the point of the competition now?” he asks.Supporting him, actress Ambili Devi, who won seven prizes at the 2001 fest, says, “I am not against grades as there will be many talents apart from the best three. Let them give an A grade to them but the best should be acknowledged. It is like you contest strongly at the school and district levels and then at the state level, everyone is considered equal. The government has probably adopted this to reduce appeals and other discrepancies, but I think those aspects shouldn’t come in the way of the spirit of youth festival.”The new system also deprives students the ability to handle failure, says 1996’s Kalaprathiba Dr Sreehari G K. “In every competition, there will be a best performer like in a marathon or a 100 metre race. The basic intention of a competition is to give the children an idea of success and failure and prepare them to face the future. In our time, we never felt those won were greater than those who didn’t as there was always a healthy competition, mutual respect and acceptance. Now in the name of stress, we are creating a lethargic generation who is incapable of handling minute stress,” he says.According to Silvastar, the stress and discrepancies are more prevalent at the lower levels. “A lot of politics happen at school levels and children are pressurised and even emotionally hurt. If it is about creating healthy competitions, the government should first monitor selection process of the youth festival at these levels,” he explains.Former winner and engineering student Amrutha S, from Palakad who has accompanied her sister Gopika for this year’s event, says the grading system takes away the charm of the fest. “I lost all interest the moment I heard about the revised manual,” she says. “There should be a winner. Only those who have been part of the previous fests and have won or lost will know the beauty of it. It is not just nostalgia, it was our first step to face the bigger world outside.”Echoing her views is BDS student Megha Muraleedaran from Malappuram who has also returned to the festival ground with good memories about late night competitions and camaraderie. “The standards may come down as the participants are aware that an average performance would fetch them an A grade. They may seem relaxed but I feel we will lose out on all the fun. What is a youth festival without winners? They have already removed Kalathilakam and Kalaprathiba title, now this too,” says Megha, who accompanied her sister, who participated in the Kathakali competition.However, there are a few who support the new system. Singer Vaishnav Girish, who earned two A grades in Ghazal and Urdu group song, says he believes the festival is just another stage performance. “I do not think we should look at it as competition. That is what my mother says. She tells me to go, enjoy and return. I think the grading system will make everyone happy,” he says.Agreeing with him, dancer teacher and actor Ramadevi says, “This will make the festival scam-free. We all know that a lot of corruption has been happening behind the scenes and most of the time the prizes didn’t go to those who deserved it. That will all change and the festival will become a creative fiesta.”  \n",

The artiste from North Paravoor, who is a Class 4 student in Aura Global School, Kodungalloor, has performed Kathakali in more than 60 stages so far, and has even portrayed roles like Mathali of Kalakeyavadham, which are only done by experienced artistes.To have a profile like that, she did start very young. “I was introduced to Kathakali when I was in kindergarten and I remember those days in bits and pieces,” she says, adding, “My parents sent me to Kathakali class saying, ‘Why don’t you try it? If you like it, you can learn it.’ When I watched it, the colours, music and mudras appeared to be a lot of fun.”It was under her first guru Sathi Sreekumar that Vishrutha learned the basics of the art, vaithari, kaal sadhakam et al. She staged her arangettam when she was in Class 2 and over the years, she says, her love for the art form grew manifold as she learned more. “The various stories and aspects of Kathakali fascinate me every time I learn something new. My current guru, FACT Biju Bhaskar, is the one who taught me the stories of the art form,” she says. Vishrutha has portrayed a variety of characters like Krishnan, Prahladan and more, but wants to do more of kathi veshams.“I am now learning the young Ravanan’s character in Ravanotbhavam,” Vishrutha says, adding that playing Mathali was another memorable experience. “I don’t think anyone my age has previously performed Mathali on stage. It’s done by senior artistes, and that gives me immense pride.”On her favourite performers of the art form, she says, “Kalamandalam Gopi aasan used to be my favourite till some time ago. Now, I like my guruji’s performances better because his veshabhangi is incomparable and kathi veshams are superb. When he plays women characters, for instance, you wouldn’t know the difference, despite him being a man. I too want to try out some female roles soon, like those in Duryodhanavadham,” Vishrutha says.The young artiste’s talent isn’t limited to Kathakali alone but also finds time to learn Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam and Kuchipudi under R L V Unnikrishnan, Dr Neena Prasad and Sreelakshmi Govardhan, respectively. How easy is it for her to manage school, along with all of these trainings? “We have a lot to study at school too. Sometimes, I study from 7 pm to 12 pm, especially during examination times, to compensate for lost hours,” she exclaims.However, Vishrutha is yet to showcase Kathakali at school. “I have only performed dance at school. My friends never recognise me in my Kathakali make-up, when they see photographs or programmes. ‘Is that really you, Vishrutha?’ they ask me. I don’t think even an ounce of my casual look gets retained when I put on the Kathakali make-up,” she says.Of late, Vishrutha has also stepped into the world of cinema. She is part of a children’s film titled Papas, directed by Sampath. “I play a character named Meenu in the film, who lived around 1984. She is nine years old and is the girlfriend of the lead character,” Vishrutha says.Will she continue with Kathakali when she grows up? “My dream is to be an established Kathakali artiste. At times, my mom says in jest why not become a doctor, but I guess my parents also want me to be an artiste,” she says.Vishrutha’s parents, Vijayakumar and Sindhu, are settled in North Paravoor. Her mom Sindhu says, “We didn’t get her interested in these art forms for anything else, but to make her a good artiste. However, she is too young to figure it all out now. If she grows up and decides to be a meritorious artiste, we would consider that a great achievement.”  \n",

By mid 2017, we had decided to scale up the project to an international level and had apprised Prithviraj of roping in Vikram. He was completely fine with it,” says Vimal.However, the Ennu Ninte Moideen director says that Vikram had his doubts when he had initially approached him for the movie based on the character in Mahabharatha.“When I first contacted him on phone, Vikram was sceptical. That’s because in Tamil, Sivaji Ganesan had played Karnan and in Telugu there was an epic film by NT Rama Rao titled Daana Veera Soora Karna. So, he wanted to know how this film was going to be different,” he says.This prompted the director to meet the actor in person and narrate the screenplay, which he has been working for the past three years.“Once he heard the script narration and understood the in-depth research for it, he was convinced. Also, we will be using cutting edge technology to recreate this period,” says Vimal.Apart from Vikram, the movie will have several stars from different film industries with “major Hollywood actor playing Bhima,” says Vimal, adding that Dangal’s casting director Mukesh Chhabra is also part of the movie.While Vikram is no stranger to transforming his body to suit the character, this film too will have him pushing his limits to play the warrior. “He has already started working out and will be trained by international action choreographers abroad for the war sequences of the film,” says the filmmaker.Mahavir Karna, which will be made in Hindi and released in other languages, will go on floors in October 2018 and is expected to release by December 2019. The movie will be shot in Niagara waterfalls in Canada, Hyderabad and Jaipur.  "
