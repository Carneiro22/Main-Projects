       "      <td>Sruthy Yedulal became a name to reckon with as one of the contestants of Flowers TV’s popular reality show, Malayali Veettamma. Last week, the lady from Thrissur became more than a contestant, as she emerged the winner of the show, after a splendid performance on the finale.She also walked away with a flat worth `1 crore and a car. From the ladder dance to aerial performances, she eased all the rounds of the finale and proved to be a deserving winner. Sruthy gets candid about the win and her experience on the show:When you became one among the final five, did you expect to win?Though I wished to enter the final list, I did not ever pray or wish to win the show. I used to have dreams about others emerging as winners. All I was determined to do was give my best and work hard.Describe your journey in Malayali Veettama.I was an introvert prior to the contest. I came across the ad of the reality show on the channel and wanted to give it a try. Thus I went for the audition in Thrissur and was one among the 200 participants. I never expected to get selected. After three months of audition, I got a surprise call from the channel and was informed that I got selected for the final audition for the show. Thus I attended it, which was a grooming round, from which 20 contestants for the show were again selected. I was one of them. Thus, we had one month grooming session in November 2016, by writer-cum-actor Jayaprakash Kuloor. Though we were competitors, the 20 participants developed a strong bond with each other in the grooming period.Did you evolve, as a person, through the show?I was active in cultural activities during my school days. But I became reserved during my graduation days in college and also got busy with my job as a bank employee and my family. I was a person who used to pull myself back from activities, as I doubted my skills. After being part of Malayali Veettama, I started to explore my artistic skills and utilise my calibre to the maximum. I must say that the tasks and rounds given to us in the reality show helped me regain my self-confidence.After winning the title, I feel empowered and have a strong willpower to accomplish anything that comes across my life.Another factor is that I could learn what goes behind the production of a show, its camera angles, and more. I also learned more about acting and dancing, and I guess I could do away with my camera fear as well.Being the winner of the show, what is your message for women?To all those women out there, I want to say that they should be confident in themselves. We are all beautiful souls. Also, be aware of your skills and utilise them the best. Never think that marriage means the end of your dreams. Make sure that you have the support of your husband and his family too. Family is our strength so it’s also important not to side-line our duties as a member. If I achieved something then it is because my family supported me and gave wings to my dreams.Tell us about your family.I am the mother of a two-year-old girl, Vaidehi, and we live in Guruvayoor. She was only nine months old when I auditioned for the show. My heartfelt thanks to the director of the show, Anoop John, as he ensured that I can also take care of my baby and feed her on time, while shooting. When I had to get on the stage, my mother or mother-in-law used to take care of her. After the initial episodes, Vaidehi also became used to it. My husband Yedulal is a bank employee at Thrissur.What were your favourite moments on the show?I must say the tasks which gave me the best comments. In the marketing round, I was asked to sell methiyadi on the stage and I could give a convincing performance. Another round which was very emotional for me was Amma Manas, in which we had to surprise our mothers. The most joyous moment was when my husband performed a skit on stage, that too for the first time in his life and also got appreciated by the judges.And what was the great challenge for you?As I wanted to showcase something unique, I performed a rope dance and ladder dance for the final. Choreographer Rajesh, from Kollam, helped me to perform both. I was a bit scared as both required months of training, while I only had a few days’ time. I even got my leg injured in the initial try but I did not give up. Later, I attempted a stunt too, by bending an iron rod with my neck and breaking a rock laying on a bed of iron nails. Being scared of heights, I still remember how I shivered when I climbed a horizontal ladder and conquered my fear.Up next?During the marketing round, prominent hair stylist Ambika Pillai, one of the judges of the show, said that I have what it takes to be a radio jockey. So, now it is my dream to become one. I am a huge fan of actress Srinda and I also wish to act in films, like her, if I get good roles in which I can perform well.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Want to make 2018 the best year for your skin? Then, you do need to step up your beauty game! From removing your make-up to pampering yourself, you can easily follow these resolutions for the New Year and a new you!1. Don’t skip your sunscreenOne of the most important skincare habits to follow is applying a sunscreen. Be it winters or summers, your skin can be prone to damage in any weather. Wearing sunscreen on a daily basis can prevent premature aging, tanning, and even skin cancer. It’s always good to apply the sunscreen 15 minutes before stepping out. By doing this, the cream will absorb and protect better.2. Always moisturiseWith the harsh weather, pollution, and daily make-up your skin demands some TLC. Make sure you apply a moisturiser (suiting your skin type), during the night and in the morning. And never forget your eyes—the skin around your eyes is the thinnest and is more prone to dryness and ageing. To address these issues, do apply an eye cream in a circular motion to improve skin’s elasticity.3. Never sleep with your make-up on The worst thing you can do to your skin is sleeping with your make-up on. And don’t we do that a lot of times? Well, this can ruin your skin! From skin allergies to breakouts, your skin can suffer a lot when you don’t remove your make-up. So, next time make sure you remove your layers of foundation and eye make-up before sleeping. For the days, you’re too lazy to hit the washroom, just keep a pack of make-up removing wipes near your bed.4. Always clean your make-up brushesYour make-up brushes can have more bacteria than you can even think of. According to experts, you should clean your brushes once a month, while eye brushes should be cleaned twice a month. This easy resolution will always keep your skin healthy and breakout free.5. And don’t forget to pamper yourself!If you’re the busy one, try to keep at least one day a week for yourself. Indulge in deep-cleansing facials, hair massages, pedicure, etc. This 'me time' will surely pamper you and enhance your beauty.</td>\n",

       "0  Sruthy Yedulal became a name to reckon with as one of the contestants of Flowers TV’s popular reality show, Malayali Veettamma. Last week, the lady from Thrissur became more than a contestant, as she emerged the winner of the show, after a splendid performance on the finale.She also walked away with a flat worth `1 crore and a car. From the ladder dance to aerial performances, she eased all the rounds of the finale and proved to be a deserving winner. Sruthy gets candid about the win and her experience on the show:When you became one among the final five, did you expect to win?Though I wished to enter the final list, I did not ever pray or wish to win the show. I used to have dreams about others emerging as winners. All I was determined to do was give my best and work hard.Describe your journey in Malayali Veettama.I was an introvert prior to the contest. I came across the ad of the reality show on the channel and wanted to give it a try. Thus I went for the audition in Thrissur and was one among the 200 participants. I never expected to get selected. After three months of audition, I got a surprise call from the channel and was informed that I got selected for the final audition for the show. Thus I attended it, which was a grooming round, from which 20 contestants for the show were again selected. I was one of them. Thus, we had one month grooming session in November 2016, by writer-cum-actor Jayaprakash Kuloor. Though we were competitors, the 20 participants developed a strong bond with each other in the grooming period.Did you evolve, as a person, through the show?I was active in cultural activities during my school days. But I became reserved during my graduation days in college and also got busy with my job as a bank employee and my family. I was a person who used to pull myself back from activities, as I doubted my skills. After being part of Malayali Veettama, I started to explore my artistic skills and utilise my calibre to the maximum. I must say that the tasks and rounds given to us in the reality show helped me regain my self-confidence.After winning the title, I feel empowered and have a strong willpower to accomplish anything that comes across my life.Another factor is that I could learn what goes behind the production of a show, its camera angles, and more. I also learned more about acting and dancing, and I guess I could do away with my camera fear as well.Being the winner of the show, what is your message for women?To all those women out there, I want to say that they should be confident in themselves. We are all beautiful souls. Also, be aware of your skills and utilise them the best. Never think that marriage means the end of your dreams. Make sure that you have the support of your husband and his family too. Family is our strength so it’s also important not to side-line our duties as a member. If I achieved something then it is because my family supported me and gave wings to my dreams.Tell us about your family.I am the mother of a two-year-old girl, Vaidehi, and we live in Guruvayoor. She was only nine months old when I auditioned for the show. My heartfelt thanks to the director of the show, Anoop John, as he ensured that I can also take care of my baby and feed her on time, while shooting. When I had to get on the stage, my mother or mother-in-law used to take care of her. After the initial episodes, Vaidehi also became used to it. My husband Yedulal is a bank employee at Thrissur.What were your favourite moments on the show?I must say the tasks which gave me the best comments. In the marketing round, I was asked to sell methiyadi on the stage and I could give a convincing performance. Another round which was very emotional for me was Amma Manas, in which we had to surprise our mothers. The most joyous moment was when my husband performed a skit on stage, that too for the first time in his life and also got appreciated by the judges.And what was the great challenge for you?As I wanted to showcase something unique, I performed a rope dance and ladder dance for the final. Choreographer Rajesh, from Kollam, helped me to perform both. I was a bit scared as both required months of training, while I only had a few days’ time. I even got my leg injured in the initial try but I did not give up. Later, I attempted a stunt too, by bending an iron rod with my neck and breaking a rock laying on a bed of iron nails. Being scared of heights, I still remember how I shivered when I climbed a horizontal ladder and conquered my fear.Up next?During the marketing round, prominent hair stylist Ambika Pillai, one of the judges of the show, said that I have what it takes to be a radio jockey.

       "3  Want to make 2018 the best year for your skin? Then, you do need to step up your beauty game! From removing your make-up to pampering yourself, you can easily follow these resolutions for the New Year and a new you!1. Don’t skip your sunscreenOne of the most important skincare habits to follow is applying a sunscreen. Be it winters or summers, your skin can be prone to damage in any weather. Wearing sunscreen on a daily basis can prevent premature aging, tanning, and even skin cancer. It’s always good to apply the sunscreen 15 minutes before stepping out. By doing this, the cream will absorb and protect better.2. Always moisturiseWith the harsh weather, pollution, and daily make-up your skin demands some TLC. Make sure you apply a moisturiser (suiting your skin type), during the night and in the morning. And never forget your eyes—the skin around your eyes is the thinnest and is more prone to dryness and ageing. To address these issues, do apply an eye cream in a circular motion to improve skin’s elasticity.3. Never sleep with your make-up on The worst thing you can do to your skin is sleeping with your make-up on. And don’t we do that a lot of times? Well, this can ruin your skin! From skin allergies to breakouts, your skin can suffer a lot when you don’t remove your make-up. So, next time make sure you remove your layers of foundation and eye make-up before sleeping. For the days, you’re too lazy to hit the washroom, just keep a pack of make-up removing wipes near your bed.4. Always clean your make-up brushesYour make-up brushes can have more bacteria than you can even think of. According to experts, you should clean your brushes once a month, while eye brushes should be cleaned twice a month. This easy resolution will always keep your skin healthy and breakout free.5.

The saffron fringes will organise mega love jihad awareness campaign across Udupi, Kasaragod and Dakshina Kannada from January 3.It was announced by MB Puranik , working president, VHP, Karnataka, who said that the cases of love jihad are increasing everyday increasing in DK, Udupi, and Kasaragod districts. He alleged that Muslim organisation like Popular Front of India and some others linked with terrorism are forcefully converting Hindu girls by making love drama. “Once they are married to them, their life is trouble. They are using these victims for terror related activities. So to curb this where innocent girls are used by Muslim were are holding a campaign against Love Jihad,” he alleged and pointed out that Love Jihad is proved in India.As a part of the campaigns, members of saffron fringe will visit every houses, schools, and offices in districts and will distribute the handbills with literature of awareness on Love Jihad. They will also hold talks with parents of Hindu girls.Apart from it, they are also planning to have committee in every village with meeting conducted every month. The campaign will end on January 15.They have also requested 23-year-old law student incident to be probe by NIA, who became facebook friend with Mohammed Iqbal Choudary from Mumbai, later eloped and married him.</td>\n",

Apart from being a musical extravaganza, the fete also ensures to popularise the compositions of Swathi Thirunal.Each year the festival witnesses big-wigs as well as upcoming talents, says its organiser Aswathy Thirunal Rama Varma, a successor of Swathi Tirunal and a singer and veena artiste himself. “It has been entertaining the city since 1999. And being the organiser I have always tried to include fresh faces for the event. This is apart from those eminent singers who haven’t participated in the event before and young talents who are sure to keep the tradition of classical music alive. The compositions performed here are strictly based on works by Swathi Thirunal.”The festival will kick off with a performance by young artiste Palghat R Ramprasad, who would be accompanied by Avaneeswaram S R Vinu on violin, G Babu on mridangam and Perukavu P L Sudheer on ghatam.The second day will mark the first performance of popular artiste Manda Sudharani at the fete also known as Kuthiramalika Festival. She will be performing with her daughter Sruti Ravali.“Sruti performed well at the national-level competition Naad-Bhed - The Mystery of Sound, which was conducted by Doordarshan, and is now a renowned figure in the classical music arena. My aim was to introduce such music talents who aren’t that familiar and let our audience experience their rich renditions,” he says.Another such duo who will be performing is S Ashok and M B Hariharan popularly known as Bangalore Brothers.Singer Tamarakkad Govindan Namboodiri will entertain the audience this year too. “The artiste has dedicated his life to nadopasana and it is a rare phenomenon to watch the veteran’s concert as he performs only once or twice a year. He made his debut at the festival last year and conveyed his interest to perform this year too as he said he felt a divine atmosphere when he performed the last time at the mandapam,” says Rama Varma.The highlight of the fest this year will be the concert by flautist Amith Nadig from Bengaluru on January 9. “It is a percussion concert which is a rare event in the festival. This concert will stand out as Somashekhar Jois will support the flautist through konnakol, an art of performing percussion syllables vocally. Their performance promises to amuse even those who are not well versed with the classical music genre as it is all about just music and rhythms. Somashekshar will render the konnakol for around three hours with Amith,” says Rama Varma.Meanwhile participants such as singer Amrutha Venkatesh, who will be performing ninth time, are excited to be part of it. “It is an honour to get featured in the prolific music event. I also get a chance to experience the performance of veterans of classical music and also learn the rare compositions of the Swathi Tirunal. The audience too come from across the country and even abroad to attend the annual event,” says Amrutha.This year, she plans to start her concert Pada Varnam. “It has lyrics for all the swarams. The specialities of Swathi Tirunal Pada Varnams are the beautiful swara aksharams that are embedded,” she says.The event is open to all music enthusiasts, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, says Rama Varma. “I welcome everyone who loves music to experience classical melodies,” he concludes.</td>\n",

Rana surprised his social media followers by releasing a still from the project on New Year’s Eve. While the actor will essay the role of Bandev, an environmental activist in the movie, Prabu confirms that Tollywood actor Varun Tej, too, will play a crucial role.He says, “Both Rana and Varun have equally importance roles. For now, the plan is such that the film will be made in Telugu and Hindi, and will later be dubbed in Tamil. Apart from Varun Tej, senior actor Kota Srinivasa Rao has also been brought on board. Internationally-acclaimed lensman Alphonse Roy, who has made films for BBC, National Geographic and Discovery, will crank the camera for the project.

       "      <td>By Prachi AryaGovind Namdev, best known for his villainous characters in films like The Bandit Queen and Oh My God, had been shooting for a film in the city recently. We caught up with the actor for a tete-a-tete. \"My shooting experience in Lucknow was fabulous. I am very positive about Lucknow. The way people cooperated and behaved, is way better than any other small town and city. People here have now, I think, got used to seeing stars shooting in the city, which has made them so familiar with the atmosphere. No one disturbs the shoot. Mujhe bahut achha lag raha hai yahan shooting karna,\" he says.Namdev has also shot in the city for the film Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana last year. Recalling those days, he says, \"We shot at various spots in the city and we were here for a very long time. The support that we got from the people really helped us to shoot. There was some kind of positivity that is observed here.\"Govind, who’s mostly played villainous characters, says that he always wanted to play a villain. \"When I came to Mumbai from Delhi, I observed one thing that Hindi films have only three types of roles that are the centre of attraction - the hero, heroine and villain. I was too old at that time to be a hero and the slot for heroine was not for me. So in the end, being a villain was my last resort. From then I started doing roles which were actually successful whether it was in Shola Aur Shabnam, Lajja or Virasat,\" says the actor.For the actor, portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram in Bandit Queen was one of the most difficult and challenging roles of his acting career. Govind tells us that even his family members were not supportive of the kind of role he played in the movie. \"My wife started hating me when she saw my character in the film. She was shocked and disturbed to see me like this. Her first reaction after watching the film was to kill me. Even I was shocked as to how can a person be so cruel and brutal in real life. Portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram was indeed a challenging task for me,\" says he, adding, \"There is a story behind this character. During my shooting days, we went to Chambal and I was very confused regarding my character as I had never done this kind of role earlier. I only knew that I had to play a character that is obnoxious. There was no research work regarding the character. Since the film was based on Phoolan Devi, we had to visit the jail where she was imprisoned, for the narration of the story. Dolly Ahluwalia, who was looking after the costumes, urged to meet Phoolan Devi and when she went to meet her she came back crying. On being asked she told us how Phoolan Devi had narrated her entire story and that’s when she showed her how the Thakur had plucked flesh from her chest when she was raped. So this helped me to know about the intricacies of the character that I had to portray. Ab jab-jab log woh film dekhte hain, toh mujhe gaali zaroor padti hai.\"Completing his silver jubilee on screen and spending more than 25 years in Bollywood, Govind feels that a lot of transitions have taken place in acting as well as storylines and filmmaking over the years. \"There is change in every 10 years in Bollywood in terms of content, storyline, and issues. I still remember the movies that were made 20 years ago. The filmmakers focussed on social issues, they were not commercial. Jo bhi content tha it used to be society oriented and moral-centric. There used to be a moral or lesson in every film. Koi na koi aisi baat hoti thi jo public ko achhi lage and it used to spread a spirit of positivity among the masses. And the makers used to denote a lot of time to one film so that it goes beyond perfection. But now with the advancement of technology, filmmaking has also gone under a lot of alterations. Aajkal ki films ka total commercial angle hai and plus the investment of money is so high that it is making people think in that manner and somehow a person gets deprived of the real ethics and essence of filmmaking because of high investment. Now since past two-three years, films are going more towards biopic, realistic issues which are of low budget and are highly appreciated by the people. We are now trying in to get into the shoes of the Western culture. For example, movies like Dangal, they searched for children to play the young Phogat sisters and then train them and even roped in people from abroad for stunts, which was pretty much evident when we saw it on the big screen.\"Talking about that one character he would still love to play, Namdev says, \"I have played all kinds of characters in this last 25 years and I have no desperation for more characters. But if you ask me about a character that I want to play, then I think playing Hitler would be my first preference. The character of Hitler used to interest me even as a kid as he was a poet, a romantic person, a writer. And I used to think that a person with so much of artistic sensibility, suddenly how can he become so ruthless and start killing thousands of people. This transition inside a person’s psychology fascinates me to play that character,\" says the actor.Namdev also shot for a film in Banaras. Talking about his experience in the holy city, he says, \"We shot on the ghats and roads and the public really helped us. And we got some interesting locations to shoot at as well in Banaras. I made a promise to myself that I will come again in future with my family and stay at the ghats to experience the mystic aura of the Ganga and the ghats of Banaras,\" said he.</td>\n",

       "1  From January 4, the premise of Kuthiramalika Palace in Thiruvananthapuram will come alive for the next 10 days as the palace ground will resonate with mellifluous renditions by music prodigies as part of the Swathi Sangeethotsavam.The annual music festival is observed as homage to Maharaja Swathi Thirunal Rama Varma. Apart from being a musical extravaganza, the fete also ensures to popularise the compositions of Swathi Thirunal.Each year the festival witnesses big-wigs as well as upcoming talents, says its organiser Aswathy Thirunal Rama Varma, a successor of Swathi Tirunal and a singer and veena artiste himself. “It has been entertaining the city since 1999. And being the organiser I have always tried to include fresh faces for the event. This is apart from those eminent singers who haven’t participated in the event before and young talents who are sure to keep the tradition of classical music alive. The compositions performed here are strictly based on works by Swathi Thirunal.”The festival will kick off with a performance by young artiste Palghat R Ramprasad, who would be accompanied by Avaneeswaram S R Vinu on violin, G Babu on mridangam and Perukavu P L Sudheer on ghatam.The second day will mark the first performance of popular artiste Manda Sudharani at the fete also known as Kuthiramalika Festival. She will be performing with her daughter Sruti Ravali.“Sruti performed well at the national-level competition Naad-Bhed - The Mystery of Sound, which was conducted by Doordarshan, and is now a renowned figure in the classical music arena. My aim was to introduce such music talents who aren’t that familiar and let our audience experience their rich renditions,” he says.Another such duo who will be performing is S Ashok and M B Hariharan popularly known as Bangalore Brothers.Singer Tamarakkad Govindan Namboodiri will entertain the audience this year too. “The artiste has dedicated his life to nadopasana and it is a rare phenomenon to watch the veteran’s concert as he performs only once or twice a year. He made his debut at the festival last year and conveyed his interest to perform this year too as he said he felt a divine atmosphere when he performed the last time at the mandapam,” says Rama Varma.The highlight of the fest this year will be the concert by flautist Amith Nadig from Bengaluru on January 9. “It is a percussion concert which is a rare event in the festival. This concert will stand out as Somashekhar Jois will support the flautist through konnakol, an art of performing percussion syllables vocally. Their performance promises to amuse even those who are not well versed with the classical music genre as it is all about just music and rhythms. Somashekshar will render the konnakol for around three hours with Amith,” says Rama Varma.Meanwhile participants such as singer Amrutha Venkatesh, who will be performing ninth time, are excited to be part of it. “It is an honour to get featured in the prolific music event. I also get a chance to experience the performance of veterans of classical music and also learn the rare compositions of the Swathi Tirunal. The audience too come from across the country and even abroad to attend the annual event,” says Amrutha.This year, she plans to start her concert Pada Varnam. “It has lyrics for all the swarams. The specialities of Swathi Tirunal Pada Varnams are the beautiful swara aksharams that are embedded,” she says.The event is open to all music enthusiasts, irrespective of caste, creed or religion, says Rama Varma. “I welcome everyone who loves music to experience classical melodies,” he concludes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \n",
       "2  We had reported a month ago that Prabu Solomon’s next, Haathi Mere Saathi, is a trilingual, with Rana Daggubati playing the lead role. According to the filmmaker, the movie, which will have major portions shot in Thailand, is a tribute of sorts to the yesteryear Hindi film with same name. Rana surprised his social media followers by releasing a still from the project on New Year’s Eve. While the actor will essay the role of Bandev, an environmental activist in the movie, Prabu confirms that Tollywood actor Varun Tej, too, will play a crucial role.He says, “Both Rana and Varun have equally importance roles. For now, the plan is such that the film will be made in Telugu and Hindi, and will later be dubbed in Tamil. Apart from Varun Tej, senior actor Kota Srinivasa Rao has also been brought on board.

       "4  By Prachi AryaGovind Namdev, best known for his villainous characters in films like The Bandit Queen and Oh My God, had been shooting for a film in the city recently. We caught up with the actor for a tete-a-tete. \"My shooting experience in Lucknow was fabulous. I am very positive about Lucknow. The way people cooperated and behaved, is way better than any other small town and city. People here have now, I think, got used to seeing stars shooting in the city, which has made them so familiar with the atmosphere. No one disturbs the shoot. Mujhe bahut achha lag raha hai yahan shooting karna,\" he says.Namdev has also shot in the city for the film Shaadi Mein Zaroor Aana last year. Recalling those days, he says, \"We shot at various spots in the city and we were here for a very long time. The support that we got from the people really helped us to shoot. There was some kind of positivity that is observed here.\"Govind, who’s mostly played villainous characters, says that he always wanted to play a villain. \"When I came to Mumbai from Delhi, I observed one thing that Hindi films have only three types of roles that are the centre of attraction - the hero, heroine and villain. I was too old at that time to be a hero and the slot for heroine was not for me. So in the end, being a villain was my last resort. From then I started doing roles which were actually successful whether it was in Shola Aur Shabnam, Lajja or Virasat,\" says the actor.For the actor, portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram in Bandit Queen was one of the most difficult and challenging roles of his acting career. Govind tells us that even his family members were not supportive of the kind of role he played in the movie. \"My wife started hating me when she saw my character in the film. She was shocked and disturbed to see me like this. Her first reaction after watching the film was to kill me. Even I was shocked as to how can a person be so cruel and brutal in real life. Portraying the character of Thakur Sri Ram was indeed a challenging task for me,\" says he, adding, \"There is a story behind this character. During my shooting days, we went to Chambal and I was very confused regarding my character as I had never done this kind of role earlier. I only knew that I had to play a character that is obnoxious. There was no research work regarding the character. Since the film was based on Phoolan Devi, we had to visit the jail where she was imprisoned, for the narration of the story. Dolly Ahluwalia, who was looking after the costumes, urged to meet Phoolan Devi and when she went to meet her she came back crying. On being asked she told us how Phoolan Devi had narrated her entire story and that’s when she showed her how the Thakur had plucked flesh from her chest when she was raped. So this helped me to know about the intricacies of the character that I had to portray. Ab jab-jab log woh film dekhte hain, toh mujhe gaali zaroor padti hai.\"Completing his silver jubilee on screen and spending more than 25 years in Bollywood, Govind feels that a lot of transitions have taken place in acting as well as storylines and filmmaking over the years. \"There is change in every 10 years in Bollywood in terms of content, storyline, and issues. I still remember the movies that were made 20 years ago. The filmmakers focussed on social issues, they were not commercial. Jo bhi content tha it used to be society oriented and moral-centric. There used to be a moral or lesson in every film. Koi na koi aisi baat hoti thi jo public ko achhi lage and it used to spread a spirit of positivity among the masses. And the makers used to denote a lot of time to one film so that it goes beyond perfection. But now with the advancement of technology, filmmaking has also gone under a lot of alterations. Aajkal ki films ka total commercial angle hai and plus the investment of money is so high that it is making people think in that manner and somehow a person gets deprived of the real ethics and essence of filmmaking because of high investment. Now since past two-three years, films are going more towards biopic, realistic issues which are of low budget and are highly appreciated by the people. We are now trying in to get into the shoes of the Western culture. For example, movies like Dangal, they searched for children to play the young Phogat sisters and then train them and even roped in people from abroad for stunts, which was pretty much evident when we saw it on the big screen.\"Talking about that one character he would still love to play, Namdev says, \"I have played all kinds of characters in this last 25 years and I have no desperation for more characters. But if you ask me about a character that I want to play, then I think playing Hitler would be my first preference. The character of Hitler used to interest me even as a kid as he was a poet, a romantic person, a writer. And I used to think that a person with so much of artistic sensibility, suddenly how can he become so ruthless and start killing thousands of people. This transition inside a person’s psychology fascinates me to play that character,\" says the actor.Namdev also shot for a film in Banaras. Talking about his experience in the holy city, he says, \"We shot on the ghats and roads and the public really helped us. And we got some interesting locations to shoot at as well in Banaras. I made a promise to myself that I will come again in future with my family and stay at the ghats to experience the mystic aura of the Ganga and the ghats of Banaras,\" said he.  "

Ashok plays an honest guy and the problems he faces because of this nature forms the plot. For me, honest people are the oxygen of our world, and that is why we decided to title the film Oxygen.”Elaborating on his protagonist’s character, he says, “He is an ordinary guy who undergoes a transformation. Ashok will be seen in three looks — as a student, a family man and this rugged look.”He informs that 20 per cent of the film has already been shot and the remaining portions will be completed in the next two-three months.</td>\n",

       "0  After playing soft-spoken characters in his previous films, Ashok Selvan will be seen in a rugged avatar in Oxygen, the first look of which was released on New Year’s Day. Directed by Anand Krishna, who earlier made the critically-acclaimed Metro, the film is an action crime thriller.Says the director, “The film looks at the three different sections of the society — the rich, middle-class and the poor. Ashok plays an honest guy and the problems he faces because of this nature forms the plot. For me, honest people are the oxygen of our world, and that is why we decided to title the film Oxygen.”Elaborating on his protagonist’s character, he says, “He is an ordinary guy who undergoes a transformation. Ashok will be seen in three looks — as a student, a family man and this rugged look.”He informs that 20 per cent of the film has already been shot and the remaining portions will be completed in the next two-three months.  \n",

       "      <td>When Hari Shanker, a software engineer, and Archana, a freelance make-up artiste, made public their decision to go childless, their families were flabbergasted. But the bigger shock came three years into their marriage, when the couple, who live in Kakkanad, went ahead and adopted two kittens, who are now their ‘children’. “It was a carefully thought out decision for us not to have children. Since we are not planning to have kids, why not get pets, we thought. The decision to get Persian cats was also made after long deliberation, considering the size of our apartment and the temperament of the different breeds,” says Hari. And that was how Ikru, a white and grey Persian, entered their lives, in October 2017. “In the shop, Ikru was found curled up with another black and white kitten. But since we had decided to take only one, we took just him. But then Ikru was a bit lonely, and on a whim, we went back to the shop to see if the other kitten was still there. All but him had been sold! We immediately brought him too home, that was Boo.”The two are constantly playing, and are very much attached to their parents but have their preferences, apparently. While Boo loves to cuddle upto Archana all the time and purr, Ikroo’s favourite sleeping place is on Hari’s legs, even as he works on his laptop. Their only worry now is that they are not able to take along the kittens during their travels. Hari’s job involves travelling abroad many months of the year, and he takes Archana along as well. “As of now, we put them up in boarding but we are researching on options to take them along.”They do everything possible to keep their furry kids safe and healthy, including regular visits to the vet. “I wouldn’t say they have completed us as we were already complete. They have filled our lives with happiness,” says Archana. “People call us crazy. For them, they’re just cats, animals. But we actually prefer them to kids. We have friends abroad who don’t find it all that crazy. There are plenty of couples in the West who opt to be childless for 10-15 years or for good, and have pets instead. I’m not saying I’m aping them, but it’s an inspiration and comfort when people alienate us,” says Archana. It's also because people aren't familiar with having pets at home, or haven't known their love, she says. “I always had cats at home but they were new to Hari as his family are not pet lovers. I was a bit apprehensive how he would accept them but today, he loves and takes care of them much more than me,” she says.At the same time, most of us in our State believe that the planet belongs to human beings, and that all else are encroachers, according to her. “There is also a fixed belief that studying certain subjects, getting married to certain kind of people and having kids is the ‘right’ thing to do, and the only way of life. I have no such notions. The kittens don’t expect anything in return for the kind of love they give us, and nothing makes us happier.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Born and brought up in Mumbai, even as a little child, Padma Shankar could decode any kind of tune. “My mother, Lakshmi Narayanan, is a vocalist and vainika, and any song she would sing, I could tell its swaras. So, she felt that the violin would be the right instrument for me to take up, as you need to have a keen sense of swaras to play the music. She wanted to be a musician, but couldn’t, so she wanted me to live her dream,” begins Padma Shankar.After learning Carnatic vocal under her mother, she started learning the violin under Ramakrishna Sharma, a disciple of Lalgudi Jayaraman. When she got to meet the great violinist in Mumbai, she told him that she wanted to do advance training under him.She states that while Ramakrishna Sharma was a music teacher, Lalgudi Jayaraman was a performer, a musician, a musicologist and a teacher all rolled into one. And that made a huge difference. “When a performer is your teacher, he grooms you for the stage. It’s like going to a finishing school,” she says and elaborates, “He taught me how much music you should have and how much you should present — the balance between learning and performing, what you can perform on stage, and what your stage demeanour should be. For example, when you are learning the violin, you just play it, and you are mostly looking down. But he taught me how to face the audience as I’m playing because when hundreds of people are looking at me, I cannot establish a connect with them, my audience, if I’m looking down. So, the first grooming lesson was how to sit erect while playing the violin. He made me practice looking at myself in the mirror, saying, ‘First, look into your own eyes. If you can’t see your own eyes, where can you see the audience’,” she recalls.She describes Lalgudi Jayaraman a treasure house of music. While he taught his style of music, he also wanted his students to express it in their own ways. Padma likens it to how the same kind of dress needs to be adapted differently to fit two different persons. “He would say, ‘The ragas are the same, the swaras are the same, but some things might suit you more than they suit me, and you will have to figure them out by yourself’. So, you will have the flavour of Lalgudi Jayaraman’s style, but still hear Padma’s music,” she states and adds that she is still developing that because it is very difficult to get out of the shadow cast by someone as legendary as Lalgudi Jayaraman. “There is nothing he hasn’t tried. So, it is a huge task,” she quips.She calls herself “an adventurous musician” because she tries to fit in her style of music into different genres. “I’ve been lucky because the instrument I play is, as Lalgudi sir used to say, a ‘sarva vyaapi’ — omnipresent. You can see it being used in Carnatic music, western classical, film music, pop, jazz, folk… everywhere,” she gushes.Padma feels that there is a lot of difference between an instrumentalist who has learnt vocals and one who hasn’t. “There is an amount of emotion involved when you are a vocalist. And you have the meaning of the lyrics in your heart, and that makes a lot of difference. The movement of the bow in our Indian music is called the ‘gayaki style’ — the singing style. It is important we follow this style because words are important in our music,” explains the violinist.Adapting, rather than unlearning, is what is important when playing fusion music, she informs. “Even when I play a Christmas carol, people will remark that I’m playing a Christmas carol in Carnatic style — even if I’m not playing so. It is intrinsic. I think the beauty lies in not adapting entirely, but giving the music a part of your culture. I don’t think any music tradition has the kind of gamakas that Carnatic music has,” she states.Padma has also dabbled in film music, playing for the likes of Karthik Raaja, Harris Jayaraj, and Achu. She has also been part of the re-recording of many films. “The precision of re-recording is amazing. In a classical background, you have a free style. In a film set-up, you will get 10 seconds in which you need to play three bars, so your precision has to be higher and that is what I find challenging,” she says.During the December season, she can be seen on stage as an accompanist and also as a solo violinist, and Padma says that there is quite a difference in these two roles. “As an accompanist, you are mainly complementing the vocalist, while in a solo concert, you are the queen,” she describes.In December 2017, she had the honour of playing at the prestigious Savai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, as a soloist, the first Carnatic violinist to do so. “It was an audience of 12,000 people and I played abhangs on the violin. I played Purandaradasa’s Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma, not in our traditional style, but the way Bhimsen Joshi sang. That was very well received,” she shares.She admits that Chennai is full of purists, “but if you get them to nod their heads and say, ‘Bhesh’ or ‘Bhale’, then you can make your mark in any corner of the world”. “We also have people who like explorations and experimentations by musicians, especially among the younger generation. The audience is opening of late,” she feels.The Margazhi music festival had to contend with natural disasters for the past couple of years, resulting in fewer audiences, but this season, too, the audience hasn’t increased a lot, Padma feels. “A lot of our music is being freely webcast, so many people have started to feel that it is a big task to go to listen to live music. This is quite sad because when you listen to music in a live ambience, it is a totally different experience; it’s just like how there is a huge difference between watching a movie in a theatre and in your home. The energy you feel in a live concert is totally stimulating,” she says.She also agrees that there are so many concerts happening during the season that the audience gets confused. “There is too much choice. We’ve got into a situation where there is a kutcheri happening every other street,” she feels. But she thinks that giving opportunities to youngsters is a good thing. “Performing is very different from learning. When someone gets on to the stage to perform, it is a different ball game. No matter the size of the audience, if you are on stage and facing a bunch of people sitting in the audience, that becomes a learning experience. The audience for the early morning concerts and the junior concerts are usually families of the youngsters cheering them on, but every musician has passed that stage,” she says.She also feels that social media has to lead to the audience opening up to younger talents and leading to discovery of many talents. “It is much better than what we had. In our days, it was usually our guru’s recommendation or word-of-mouth that led to audiences turning up for our concerts, but now, almost every budding musician has a YouTube page. They are advertising their concert on Facebook and people become aware of it and go check their work online and decide to attend their concerts, which is great,” shesigns off.</td>\n",

A source close to the actress confirms, “Yes, she has been confirmed for the project. It will be an interesting role for Keerthy.” Currently, the actress is busy with the promotions of her upcoming Tamil and Telugu releases and she will soon join the shoot.The source adds, “The team had organised a look test for Vijay on January 2. Murugadoss is likely to begin shooting for the project after Pongal. And the film will most probably go on floors in Chennai.”We hear that like Murugadoss’s earlier projects, this one, too, will touch upon a pressing issue. It was only recently that the team had officially confirmed that AR Rahman will be scoring music for the film. Interestingly, this is the first time Murugadoss is collaborating with Rahman for a Tamil film; the duo had worked together for the Hindi remake of Ghajini, which marked the director’s Bollywood debut.

       "0  When Hari Shanker, a software engineer, and Archana, a freelance make-up artiste, made public their decision to go childless, their families were flabbergasted. But the bigger shock came three years into their marriage, when the couple, who live in Kakkanad, went ahead and adopted two kittens, who are now their ‘children’. “It was a carefully thought out decision for us not to have children. Since we are not planning to have kids, why not get pets, we thought. The decision to get Persian cats was also made after long deliberation, considering the size of our apartment and the temperament of the different breeds,” says Hari. And that was how Ikru, a white and grey Persian, entered their lives, in October 2017. “In the shop, Ikru was found curled up with another black and white kitten. But since we had decided to take only one, we took just him. But then Ikru was a bit lonely, and on a whim, we went back to the shop to see if the other kitten was still there. All but him had been sold! We immediately brought him too home, that was Boo.”The two are constantly playing, and are very much attached to their parents but have their preferences, apparently. While Boo loves to cuddle upto Archana all the time and purr, Ikroo’s favourite sleeping place is on Hari’s legs, even as he works on his laptop. Their only worry now is that they are not able to take along the kittens during their travels. Hari’s job involves travelling abroad many months of the year, and he takes Archana along as well. “As of now, we put them up in boarding but we are researching on options to take them along.”They do everything possible to keep their furry kids safe and healthy, including regular visits to the vet. “I wouldn’t say they have completed us as we were already complete. They have filled our lives with happiness,” says Archana. “People call us crazy. For them, they’re just cats, animals. But we actually prefer them to kids. We have friends abroad who don’t find it all that crazy. There are plenty of couples in the West who opt to be childless for 10-15 years or for good, and have pets instead. I’m not saying I’m aping them, but it’s an inspiration and comfort when people alienate us,” says Archana. It's also because people aren't familiar with having pets at home, or haven't known their love, she says. “I always had cats at home but they were new to Hari as his family are not pet lovers. I was a bit apprehensive how he would accept them but today, he loves and takes care of them much more than me,” she says.At the same time, most of us in our State believe that the planet belongs to human beings, and that all else are encroachers, according to her. “There is also a fixed belief that studying certain subjects, getting married to certain kind of people and having kids is the ‘right’ thing to do, and the only way of life. I have no such notions. The kittens don’t expect anything in return for the kind of love they give us, and nothing makes us happier.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1  Born and brought up in Mumbai, even as a little child, Padma Shankar could decode any kind of tune. “My mother, Lakshmi Narayanan, is a vocalist and vainika, and any song she would sing, I could tell its swaras. So, she felt that the violin would be the right instrument for me to take up, as you need to have a keen sense of swaras to play the music. She wanted to be a musician, but couldn’t, so she wanted me to live her dream,” begins Padma Shankar.After learning Carnatic vocal under her mother, she started learning the violin under Ramakrishna Sharma, a disciple of Lalgudi Jayaraman. When she got to meet the great violinist in Mumbai, she told him that she wanted to do advance training under him.She states that while Ramakrishna Sharma was a music teacher, Lalgudi Jayaraman was a performer, a musician, a musicologist and a teacher all rolled into one. And that made a huge difference. “When a performer is your teacher, he grooms you for the stage. It’s like going to a finishing school,” she says and elaborates, “He taught me how much music you should have and how much you should present — the balance between learning and performing, what you can perform on stage, and what your stage demeanour should be. For example, when you are learning the violin, you just play it, and you are mostly looking down. But he taught me how to face the audience as I’m playing because when hundreds of people are looking at me, I cannot establish a connect with them, my audience, if I’m looking down. So, the first grooming lesson was how to sit erect while playing the violin. He made me practice looking at myself in the mirror, saying, ‘First, look into your own eyes. If you can’t see your own eyes, where can you see the audience’,” she recalls.She describes Lalgudi Jayaraman a treasure house of music. While he taught his style of music, he also wanted his students to express it in their own ways. Padma likens it to how the same kind of dress needs to be adapted differently to fit two different persons. “He would say, ‘The ragas are the same, the swaras are the same, but some things might suit you more than they suit me, and you will have to figure them out by yourself’. So, you will have the flavour of Lalgudi Jayaraman’s style, but still hear Padma’s music,” she states and adds that she is still developing that because it is very difficult to get out of the shadow cast by someone as legendary as Lalgudi Jayaraman. “There is nothing he hasn’t tried. So, it is a huge task,” she quips.She calls herself “an adventurous musician” because she tries to fit in her style of music into different genres. “I’ve been lucky because the instrument I play is, as Lalgudi sir used to say, a ‘sarva vyaapi’ — omnipresent. You can see it being used in Carnatic music, western classical, film music, pop, jazz, folk… everywhere,” she gushes.Padma feels that there is a lot of difference between an instrumentalist who has learnt vocals and one who hasn’t. “There is an amount of emotion involved when you are a vocalist. And you have the meaning of the lyrics in your heart, and that makes a lot of difference. The movement of the bow in our Indian music is called the ‘gayaki style’ — the singing style. It is important we follow this style because words are important in our music,” explains the violinist.Adapting, rather than unlearning, is what is important when playing fusion music, she informs. “Even when I play a Christmas carol, people will remark that I’m playing a Christmas carol in Carnatic style — even if I’m not playing so. It is intrinsic. I think the beauty lies in not adapting entirely, but giving the music a part of your culture. I don’t think any music tradition has the kind of gamakas that Carnatic music has,” she states.Padma has also dabbled in film music, playing for the likes of Karthik Raaja, Harris Jayaraj, and Achu. She has also been part of the re-recording of many films. “The precision of re-recording is amazing. In a classical background, you have a free style. In a film set-up, you will get 10 seconds in which you need to play three bars, so your precision has to be higher and that is what I find challenging,” she says.During the December season, she can be seen on stage as an accompanist and also as a solo violinist, and Padma says that there is quite a difference in these two roles. “As an accompanist, you are mainly complementing the vocalist, while in a solo concert, you are the queen,” she describes.In December 2017, she had the honour of playing at the prestigious Savai Gandharva Bhimsen Mahotsav, as a soloist, the first Carnatic violinist to do so. “It was an audience of 12,000 people and I played abhangs on the violin. I played Purandaradasa’s Bhagyada Lakshmi Baramma, not in our traditional style, but the way Bhimsen Joshi sang. That was very well received,” she shares.She admits that Chennai is full of purists, “but if you get them to nod their heads and say, ‘Bhesh’ or ‘Bhale’, then you can make your mark in any corner of the world”. “We also have people who like explorations and experimentations by musicians, especially among the younger generation. The audience is opening of late,” she feels.The Margazhi music festival had to contend with natural disasters for the past couple of years, resulting in fewer audiences, but this season, too, the audience hasn’t increased a lot, Padma feels. “A lot of our music is being freely webcast, so many people have started to feel that it is a big task to go to listen to live music. This is quite sad because when you listen to music in a live ambience, it is a totally different experience; it’s just like how there is a huge difference between watching a movie in a theatre and in your home. The energy you feel in a live concert is totally stimulating,” she says.She also agrees that there are so many concerts happening during the season that the audience gets confused. “There is too much choice. We’ve got into a situation where there is a kutcheri happening every other street,” she feels. But she thinks that giving opportunities to youngsters is a good thing. “Performing is very different from learning. When someone gets on to the stage to perform, it is a different ball game. No matter the size of the audience, if you are on stage and facing a bunch of people sitting in the audience, that becomes a learning experience. The audience for the early morning concerts and the junior concerts are usually families of the youngsters cheering them on, but every musician has passed that stage,” she says.She also feels that social media has to lead to the audience opening up to younger talents and leading to discovery of many talents. “It is much better than what we had. In our days, it was usually our guru’s recommendation or word-of-mouth that led to audiences turning up for our concerts, but now, almost every budding musician has a YouTube page. They are advertising their concert on Facebook and people become aware of it and go check their work online and decide to attend their concerts, which is great,” shesigns off.  \n",

A source close to the actress confirms, “Yes, she has been confirmed for the project. It will be an interesting role for Keerthy.” Currently, the actress is busy with the promotions of her upcoming Tamil and Telugu releases and she will soon join the shoot.The source adds, “The team had organised a look test for Vijay on January 2. Murugadoss is likely to begin shooting for the project after Pongal.

Interestingly, she is a vegetarian in real life! “It wasn’t easy in the beginning,” she admits. “I couldn’t stand the sight or the smell of raw meat. But I had to do it for the character and finally, I guess I got used to it over time.” In her scenes, she works wearing a messy, stained shirt. “That’s what Anitha looks like while at work. But she appears in normal saris and salwars too,” Sshivada says.All of her portions were shot inside a forest but hey, Sshivada was no rookie at it. “Even my first movie Nedunchalai had a lot of scenes in the forest, so I was kind of used to it. But the days at Bhoothathankettu did offer me some first-time experiences,” she reveals. “I saw a boa for the first time! Everyone on the set kept talking about seeing elephants, about how they once trampled down a set for a temple, and I was wondering why I didn’t see any. On the day of my pack-up, I saw not one, but seven of them right next to my vehicle. It was a family, with elders and the young ones,” she recollects excitedly.Sshivada is also shooting for her Tamil film Iravaakalam, directed by Maya fame Ashwin Saravanan, which also has S J Surya and Wamiqa Gabbi in the lead roles. “My character in it, Madhumita, is a girl who goes around film sets asking for a chance to act. She is quite stylish compared to the characters I have done, and I also have a wider range of emotions to play for her.” Sshivada has been shooting in Chennai and Ootty for the film. The shoot for her next in Malayalam, Chanakyathanthram, in which she plays the CEO of a company, is also going on alongside.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Mayor wants to crush and flush; activists say #KitchenPulveriserBeda</td>\n",
       "      <td>The recent call by Bengaluru Mayor Sampath Raj to make kitchen pulverisers mandatory (to reduce solid kitchen waste from going into landfills) has experts seeing red. Kitchen pulverisers — small electric grinder machines installed below kitchen sink that crush any food dumped into it into an almost liquid form — are popular in the West, but activists say that it is just not viable in a city like Bengaluru that lacks the infrastructure that cities in the West do. Therefore, it will only add to our woes.Members of the Bangalore Eco Team recently started a petition online to garner support of Bengalureans and meet the Mayor to show him that the city is not for this form of garbage disposal. “When we met the Mayor earlier about the construction debris issue, he told us about making kitchen pulverisers mandatory for hotels and new houses. We told him then that it’s a bad idea. Our STP (sewerage treatment plant) expert, environment engineer Dr Ananth S Kodavasal, had a couple for meetings with the Mayor and other officials and explained the impact this will have on STPs. Our lakes are already struggling with under capacity STPs, and at this point to introduce another input will clog drains; the city saw flooding in October, all because of clogged drains. We expressed this to the Mayor, but even after that he told the press about making it mandatory. We were about 30-35 activists then, so we thought that we should garner larger support (via the online petition) and get back to him to show that the citizens don’t support this,” says Seema Sharma of the Bangalore Eco Team.The team suggests that there are better and simpler ways of keeping waste out of landfills, such as composting. “If anything needs to be mandated — like Seattle in USA, Havana in Cuba and closer home in Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram — it should be composting on premises. Our city isn’t able to handle sewerage at this point; we can’t add to the load with pulverizing. The BBMP began composting santhes, and, in June, they mooted making composting on premises mandatory, but nothing has been implemented. When we spoke to BWSSB officials, they had no idea about how to take care of crushed food. Pulverisers require a lot of water to drain out the crushed waste — how feasible is that when we are already suffering from water shortage? If we have to copy the West, we need infrastructure like them. When we have good home solutions, such as composting, why ape anyone else? Take a note from Alappuzha, which is among the five cities in the world that are working towards curbing pollution through their sustainable solid waste management practices. They achieved this only by making composting and bio gas mandatory, for which the government provides high subsidies for this. We should be implementing that here,” adds Seema.ADDING TO OUR WOESThe Bangalore Eco Team says that there are many drawbacks to kitchen pulverisers, such as…Waste of fresh water: Each kitchen will need between 10-20 litres of extra fresh water every day to flush down the pulverised food. The city already has acute water shortage.The food will kill STPs: When the crushed food is added to the sewage, its biological oxygen demand will more than double. That means our STPs have to double their capacity overnight. Our STPs are not designed for this load. They will simply fail, and we will have to discharge partially treated sewage to the drains and lakes.The oil and fat content will cause foaming in STPs, kill bacteria: People will pour their used oil and fat in the kitchen sink, which will directly reach the STPs. The fat content will cause a blanket of thick, brown foam on STP tanks, which lowers the efficiency of the bacteria and reduce aeration.The food sludge will block sewerage pipes: Our drainage system is mainly gravity-fed, not pumped. In this type of pipelines, when the sewage flow slows down, it leaves sediments behind. Thus, the sediment builds up gradually and reduces the flow even further. Ultimately it will block the pipe completely.Flooding will get aggravated: Bengaluru sees regular flooding, and when drains are blocked with food sludge, the flooding will increase multifold. When pipes are blocked, the raw sewage will burst out of the manholes and flow freely across the roads.Lakes and drains will be filled with raw sewage and food mix: When STPs belonging to apartments and BWSSB are killed, the raw sewage will reach the drains and lakes. This will kill even those lakes that have recently been rejuvenated.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Micro review: 'The Boat-wreck' is a moving tale of human lives</td>\n",
       "      <td>The Boat-wreck is a translation of Rabindranath Tagore’s Bengali novel Noukadubi, by Arunava Sinha. As the title suggests, the novel is the story of a boat wreck, and the ensuing catastrophe it brings about in two families. Adorned with evocative language and exquisite depictions of nature, The Boat-Wreck is a moving tale of human lives stuck between the wheels of fortune, and of complicated human relationships.Two wedding parties drown in a boat wreck with the only survivors being one of the bridegrooms Ramesh, and the other party’s bride, Kamala. Kamala and Ramesh, who had not seen their respective partners before their wedding, believe they are married to each other as they try to move on from their recent misfortunes and settle in each other’s company. The story takes a turn as a wonderful romance brews between the couple -- a very meek Kamala and a caring Ramesh. Though he gets to spot the error soon, Ramesh, full of remorse, remains attracted to her. But their cosy world soon collapses as Kamala leaves him the moment she comes to know the truth. A series of adventures take both Kamala and Ramesh to Benaras, where they meet each other again in the most unlikely of circumstances. In a poetic narrative full of charismatic encounters, Tagore weaves a tale of love, fate and emotional upheavals.Tagore has always been known as one of the most farsighted philosophers. Even if some parts of the novel may seem dated, Tagore has portrayed certain nuances of society that are still relevant. Arunava Sinha’s language effortlessly blends with Tagore’s diction making the read a poetic experience. Written with Tagore’s philosophical insight and romantic fervour, The Boat-wreck is an early twentieth-century depiction of love that goes beyond ownership. ­­­­How critics view the book:Gulzar said in a review, \"Tagore picks up the flotsam of a love story from the Ganga and narrates it like only he can. An eternal human story.\"</td>\n",

       "0  Probably, no actress in Mollywood has ever done the character that Sshivada will be playing in her next in Malayalam.In director Sugeeth’s upcoming Kunchacko Boban starrer Shikkari Shambhu, the Su…Su…Sudhi Vathmeekam actress is playing a butcher named Anitha.“I have so far been a girl-next-door onscreen and have never tried something of this sort before,” says an excited Sshivada. Interestingly, she is a vegetarian in real life! “It wasn’t easy in the beginning,” she admits. “I couldn’t stand the sight or the smell of raw meat. But I had to do it for the character and finally, I guess I got used to it over time.” In her scenes, she works wearing a messy, stained shirt. “That’s what Anitha looks like while at work. But she appears in normal saris and salwars too,” Sshivada says.All of her portions were shot inside a forest but hey, Sshivada was no rookie at it. “Even my first movie Nedunchalai had a lot of scenes in the forest, so I was kind of used to it. But the days at Bhoothathankettu did offer me some first-time experiences,” she reveals. “I saw a boa for the first time! Everyone on the set kept talking about seeing elephants, about how they once trampled down a set for a temple, and I was wondering why I didn’t see any. On the day of my pack-up, I saw not one, but seven of them right next to my vehicle. It was a family, with elders and the young ones,” she recollects excitedly.Sshivada is also shooting for her Tamil film Iravaakalam, directed by Maya fame Ashwin Saravanan, which also has S J Surya and Wamiqa Gabbi in the lead roles. “My character in it, Madhumita, is a girl who goes around film sets asking for a chance to act. She is quite stylish compared to the characters I have done, and I also have a wider range of emotions to play for her.” Sshivada has been shooting in Chennai and Ootty for the film. The shoot for her next in Malayalam, Chanakyathanthram, in which she plays the CEO of a company, is also going on alongside.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "2  The recent call by Bengaluru Mayor Sampath Raj to make kitchen pulverisers mandatory (to reduce solid kitchen waste from going into landfills) has experts seeing red. Kitchen pulverisers — small electric grinder machines installed below kitchen sink that crush any food dumped into it into an almost liquid form — are popular in the West, but activists say that it is just not viable in a city like Bengaluru that lacks the infrastructure that cities in the West do. Therefore, it will only add to our woes.Members of the Bangalore Eco Team recently started a petition online to garner support of Bengalureans and meet the Mayor to show him that the city is not for this form of garbage disposal. “When we met the Mayor earlier about the construction debris issue, he told us about making kitchen pulverisers mandatory for hotels and new houses. We told him then that it’s a bad idea. Our STP (sewerage treatment plant) expert, environment engineer Dr Ananth S Kodavasal, had a couple for meetings with the Mayor and other officials and explained the impact this will have on STPs. Our lakes are already struggling with under capacity STPs, and at this point to introduce another input will clog drains; the city saw flooding in October, all because of clogged drains. We expressed this to the Mayor, but even after that he told the press about making it mandatory. We were about 30-35 activists then, so we thought that we should garner larger support (via the online petition) and get back to him to show that the citizens don’t support this,” says Seema Sharma of the Bangalore Eco Team.The team suggests that there are better and simpler ways of keeping waste out of landfills, such as composting. “If anything needs to be mandated — like Seattle in USA, Havana in Cuba and closer home in Alappuzha and Thiruvananthapuram — it should be composting on premises. Our city isn’t able to handle sewerage at this point; we can’t add to the load with pulverizing. The BBMP began composting santhes, and, in June, they mooted making composting on premises mandatory, but nothing has been implemented. When we spoke to BWSSB officials, they had no idea about how to take care of crushed food. Pulverisers require a lot of water to drain out the crushed waste — how feasible is that when we are already suffering from water shortage? If we have to copy the West, we need infrastructure like them. When we have good home solutions, such as composting, why ape anyone else? Take a note from Alappuzha, which is among the five cities in the world that are working towards curbing pollution through their sustainable solid waste management practices. They achieved this only by making composting and bio gas mandatory, for which the government provides high subsidies for this. We should be implementing that here,” adds Seema.ADDING TO OUR WOESThe Bangalore Eco Team says that there are many drawbacks to kitchen pulverisers, such as…Waste of fresh water: Each kitchen will need between 10-20 litres of extra fresh water every day to flush down the pulverised food. The city already has acute water shortage.The food will kill STPs: When the crushed food is added to the sewage, its biological oxygen demand will more than double. That means our STPs have to double their capacity overnight. Our STPs are not designed for this load. They will simply fail, and we will have to discharge partially treated sewage to the drains and lakes.The oil and fat content will cause foaming in STPs, kill bacteria: People will pour their used oil and fat in the kitchen sink, which will directly reach the STPs. The fat content will cause a blanket of thick, brown foam on STP tanks, which lowers the efficiency of the bacteria and reduce aeration.The food sludge will block sewerage pipes: Our drainage system is mainly gravity-fed, not pumped. In this type of pipelines, when the sewage flow slows down, it leaves sediments behind. Thus, the sediment builds up gradually and reduces the flow even further. Ultimately it will block the pipe completely.Flooding will get aggravated: Bengaluru sees regular flooding, and when drains are blocked with food sludge, the flooding will increase multifold. When pipes are blocked, the raw sewage will burst out of the manholes and flow freely across the roads.Lakes and drains will be filled with raw sewage and food mix: When STPs belonging to apartments and BWSSB are killed, the raw sewage will reach the drains and lakes. This will kill even those lakes that have recently been rejuvenated.  \n",
       "3  The Boat-wreck is a translation of Rabindranath Tagore’s Bengali novel Noukadubi, by Arunava Sinha. As the title suggests, the novel is the story of a boat wreck, and the ensuing catastrophe it brings about in two families. Adorned with evocative language and exquisite depictions of nature, The Boat-Wreck is a moving tale of human lives stuck between the wheels of fortune, and of complicated human relationships.Two wedding parties drown in a boat wreck with the only survivors being one of the bridegrooms Ramesh, and the other party’s bride, Kamala. Kamala and Ramesh, who had not seen their respective partners before their wedding, believe they are married to each other as they try to move on from their recent misfortunes and settle in each other’s company. The story takes a turn as a wonderful romance brews between the couple -- a very meek Kamala and a caring Ramesh. Though he gets to spot the error soon, Ramesh, full of remorse, remains attracted to her. But their cosy world soon collapses as Kamala leaves him the moment she comes to know the truth. A series of adventures take both Kamala and Ramesh to Benaras, where they meet each other again in the most unlikely of circumstances. In a poetic narrative full of charismatic encounters, Tagore weaves a tale of love, fate and emotional upheavals.Tagore has always been known as one of the most farsighted philosophers. Even if some parts of the novel may seem dated, Tagore has portrayed certain nuances of society that are still relevant. Arunava Sinha’s language effortlessly blends with Tagore’s diction making the read a poetic experience. Written with Tagore’s philosophical insight and romantic fervour, The Boat-wreck is an early twentieth-century depiction of love that goes beyond ownership. ­­­­How critics view the book:Gulzar said in a review, \"Tagore picks up the flotsam of a love story from the Ganga and narrates it like only he can. An eternal human story.\"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "      <td>Playback singer Maalavika Sundar is an excited woman. After all, the singer has been churning out some hit songs to her credit. Maalavika was known as Carnatic singer, until she broke the tag after she sang the hit number, Dang Dang under D Imman’s composition in Manam Kothi Paravai. Her popularity soared after the release of the song.“After the song, wherever I travelled, people called me ‘Dang Dang Maalavika’. I was scared to sing the folk number in a recording studio as I come from a Carnatic background. But Imman sir made me feel so comfortable. I was completely into Carnatic music until 2010, after which I took part in the singing reality show Super Singer.”Maalavika has sung a number of cine songs, including a few hits like Karuppu Nerathazhagi from Komban, Gum Zaare from Kadavul Irukaan Kumaru. “When I was a part of Super Singer, people used to point out the influence of Carnatic music in my cine songs, but I didn’t realise it then. Now, when I compare what I used to sing to what I am singing now, I can find a huge difference. I am happy with the progress.”So, what kind of preparation does she undergo for Carnatic concert and a cine music concert? “When you are preparing for the former, you have to be quite spontaneous. You have to prepare the different ragams and talams. You need to understand that you will be the only person on stage singing for hours together, which is not the case in cine music concerts. While performing a cine music concert, you have a set track and there isn’t much scope for improvisation.”Maalavika was in the top four of another reality show contest, Indian Idol, this year. “It was the best experience I ever had in my life. It was challenging as I didn’t know the language. In the first audition, there were nearly 20,000 people, but I was directly put into top 24. Meeting different people from different culture, I learnt a lot in few months,” says Maalavika.When quizzed about her online covers, she says, “My first cover was Ey Sandakara from Irudhi Suttru. I had a good producer for the video and it came out really well. I got a lot of appreciation from music directors Imman sir, Santosh Narayanan sir and actor Madhavan as well. Some of the music directors these days do research on YouTube before approaching a singer for recording. Gone are the days where a singer has to produce a demo. A lot of youngsters who don’t have the right opportunity are able to reach music directors today by doing such covers. It hasbecome a huge platform to exhibit your talent.”</td>\n",

But I must say that I am enjoying every bit of it,” says Swathishta, who is presently hosting the show, Compass Countdown on Puthuyugam. “I am generally someone who loves to talk. So, anchoring came naturally to me. And hosting a show only makes you widen your knowledge about several topics,” she says.Talking about the show, Swathishta says, “The show has five segments — cinema updates, celebrity tweets and gossip, viral videos on social media, news on science and technology and a section on sports. Every day, we come up with the most interesting news to give our viewers.” This 30-minute show is telecast every Friday, Saturday and Sunday.Though Swathishta enjoys anchoring, she says she’s looking forward to her film career. “I got a lot of film opportunities after I became an anchor. I am waiting for my films to release and see how my career as an actor shapes up,” she signs off.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Album: Tik Tik Tik Composer: D ImmanThis is D Imman’s 100th album and the man has left no stone unturned to ensure it sounds zesty, peppy and yet, retains his mark of melody. The album opens with the title track, which has everything going for it — powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics and a foot-tapping orchestration. With tik tik tik constantly echoing in the background, Yuvan Shankar Raja and Sunitha Sarathy deliver their punch with a lot of intensity. Add to that Yogi B’s stylish rap and what you have in hand is a formidable number like this. Madhan Karky has once again given us newer Tamil words to mull on — Evvathin nudhigaana yaatru maedhum evvaaru ingae pizhai, pavvathin thulimondu maaganjeyyaadhu vvaanil engae mazhai is just a sample.Imman follows this up with a beautiful melody, Kurumba, a new-age lullaby. The song has a father’s version and a mother’s version, and both are genuinely different, with varying soundscapes and even portions of lyrics, not just the voices. The Father’s Love is sung by Sid Sriram and is more classically inclined, with violin synth strings merging beautifully with intermittent whistling. Mirthula Siva is pitch-perfect in the Mother’s Love version and her fresh voice, westernised rendition and synth-heavy background score gives this number a newer sound. A huge shout out to Karky, for, he’s making us fall in love with Tamil all over again.Next in line is the inspirational Vinveera, and surprisingly for the genre, the energy level in the track sees a dip. Ranjith and Sri Rascol (rap) have rendered the number with all their heart and though it isn’t an ear sore, it somehow doesn’t strike a chord with us. The album has two themes — Race Against Time is crisp, bassy and reflects the mood of the film, while Far Beyond Earth is a little longer and slower. There are karaoke versions of both Tik Tik Tik and Kurumba, and with the lead singers’ voices missing, the two serve their purpose well. In short, Imman’s composition for this space film is quite out of the world.</td>\n",

       "0  Playback singer Maalavika Sundar is an excited woman. After all, the singer has been churning out some hit songs to her credit. Maalavika was known as Carnatic singer, until she broke the tag after she sang the hit number, Dang Dang under D Imman’s composition in Manam Kothi Paravai. Her popularity soared after the release of the song.“After the song, wherever I travelled, people called me ‘Dang Dang Maalavika’. I was scared to sing the folk number in a recording studio as I come from a Carnatic background. But Imman sir made me feel so comfortable. I was completely into Carnatic music until 2010, after which I took part in the singing reality show Super Singer.”Maalavika has sung a number of cine songs, including a few hits like Karuppu Nerathazhagi from Komban, Gum Zaare from Kadavul Irukaan Kumaru. “When I was a part of Super Singer, people used to point out the influence of Carnatic music in my cine songs, but I didn’t realise it then. Now, when I compare what I used to sing to what I am singing now, I can find a huge difference. I am happy with the progress.”So, what kind of preparation does she undergo for Carnatic concert and a cine music concert? “When you are preparing for the former, you have to be quite spontaneous. You have to prepare the different ragams and talams. You need to understand that you will be the only person on stage singing for hours together, which is not the case in cine music concerts. While performing a cine music concert, you have a set track and there isn’t much scope for improvisation.”Maalavika was in the top four of another reality show contest, Indian Idol, this year. “It was the best experience I ever had in my life. It was challenging as I didn’t know the language. In the first audition, there were nearly 20,000 people, but I was directly put into top 24. Meeting different people from different culture, I learnt a lot in few months,” says Maalavika.When quizzed about her online covers, she says, “My first cover was Ey Sandakara from Irudhi Suttru. I had a good producer for the video and it came out really well. I got a lot of appreciation from music directors Imman sir, Santosh Narayanan sir and actor Madhavan as well. Some of the music directors these days do research on YouTube before approaching a singer for recording. Gone are the days where a singer has to produce a demo. A lot of youngsters who don’t have the right opportunity are able to reach music directors today by doing such covers. It hasbecome a huge platform to exhibit your talent.”  \n",

       "2  For journalism graduate Swathishta, the opportunity to become an anchor came by chance. “I never dreamt of becoming an anchor. I got the offer after I completed my course. But I must say that I am enjoying every bit of it,” says Swathishta, who is presently hosting the show, Compass Countdown on Puthuyugam. “I am generally someone who loves to talk. So, anchoring came naturally to me. And hosting a show only makes you widen your knowledge about several topics,” she says.Talking about the show, Swathishta says, “The show has five segments — cinema updates, celebrity tweets and gossip, viral videos on social media, news on science and technology and a section on sports.

       "4  Album: Tik Tik Tik Composer: D ImmanThis is D Imman’s 100th album and the man has left no stone unturned to ensure it sounds zesty, peppy and yet, retains his mark of melody. The album opens with the title track, which has everything going for it — powerful vocals, meaningful lyrics and a foot-tapping orchestration. With tik tik tik constantly echoing in the background, Yuvan Shankar Raja and Sunitha Sarathy deliver their punch with a lot of intensity. Add to that Yogi B’s stylish rap and what you have in hand is a formidable number like this. Madhan Karky has once again given us newer Tamil words to mull on — Evvathin nudhigaana yaatru maedhum evvaaru ingae pizhai, pavvathin thulimondu maaganjeyyaadhu vvaanil engae mazhai is just a sample.Imman follows this up with a beautiful melody, Kurumba, a new-age lullaby. The song has a father’s version and a mother’s version, and both are genuinely different, with varying soundscapes and even portions of lyrics, not just the voices. The Father’s Love is sung by Sid Sriram and is more classically inclined, with violin synth strings merging beautifully with intermittent whistling. Mirthula Siva is pitch-perfect in the Mother’s Love version and her fresh voice, westernised rendition and synth-heavy background score gives this number a newer sound. A huge shout out to Karky, for, he’s making us fall in love with Tamil all over again.Next in line is the inspirational Vinveera, and surprisingly for the genre, the energy level in the track sees a dip. Ranjith and Sri Rascol (rap) have rendered the number with all their heart and though it isn’t an ear sore, it somehow doesn’t strike a chord with us. The album has two themes — Race Against Time is crisp, bassy and reflects the mood of the film, while Far Beyond Earth is a little longer and slower. There are karaoke versions of both Tik Tik Tik and Kurumba, and with the lead singers’ voices missing, the two serve their purpose well. In short, Imman’s composition for this space film is quite out of the world.

       "      <td>Q. You carried your pregnancy with élan and seemed to enjoy every bit of it...(Smiles) I’m sure a lot of models and actors in our country — and in the West — have done this as well. But probably, there hasn’t been a commercial actress, who’s not taken a sabbatical. But pregnancy is the most normal thing. I was excited about starting a family and I wanted to share my joy with my family, friends and fans. So, there was nothing to hide. Even the fact that I had gained some weight. I put on most of my weight during my last trimester; that was also something I celebrated. Every woman puts on weight and enjoys that period in her life. I’ve also enjoyed hitting the gym and losing weight, which has been rejuvenating in a way. So I’ve just done exactly as I pleased. Having said that, it’s not that I’m setting an example or any such thing.Q. You had no qualms about posting newborn Taimur’s photograph on social media...In today’s times, everyone is seen and is out there. You post pictures on Instagram, on Facebook... because you want to share your life with people.When I was pregnant, both Saif and I had spoken about this and how we’d handle it. He was like there’s nothing to hide. He’s our child and this is the way it’s going to be. He’s going to be photographed, so be it. It’s convenient for stars when they want to be clicked... like at events, while putting on make-up, wearing an outfit... and so on. So, why hide your child? We’re pretty open and clear about it.Q. Taimur Ali Khan’s paparazzi’s favourite…(Laughs) I do understand that. But I just don’t want him to be looked upon as a star-kid. I want him to grow up as normally as possible. I want to let him be just the way he is.Q. Your presence on social media is huge even though you are not on it. When will Kareena Kapoor Khan join the bandwagon?I’m probably more on Instagram than anyone else. My pictures are everywhere. Then I don’t need to constantly be on it, na? My sister (Karisma Kapoor) posts my pictures; my friends put my pictures… My fan clubs have kept me alive. So I don’t have to actively be out there. I guess, Saif and I aren’t cut out for being on social media. Though we’re social.Q. You stepped out for dinner just a couple of days after giving birth, post which there were some unsavoury reactions. Did it bother you?I believe it’s foolish for people to even think in this manner. Giving birth is probably the most normal thing. It’s part of life. I’ve so many friends in America, who give birth and resume work within three days because they have no option. They don’t have a battalion of nurses or nannies looking after their kid.So the concept of having to be at home and sinking into postpartum depression is not required. Even if you’re a breast-feeding mother, you can pump the milk and put it in the feeding bottle for your baby. I don’t want to give any explanations but breast-feeding can be done in different ways.If I stepped out with my husband for an hour that’s also part of the joy of being parents, of being in a happy state of mind to return home to be with your child. Saif and I have never followed norms. And we’re going to be doing what we feel right and convinced about.Q. What kind of a mother are you – chilled or hyper?Since I’m a first time mother, I’m obviously quite hyper. I don’t want to miss out on anything while he’s growing. I wish to be there all the time. I’m loving the journey each day as it unfolds something new. And of course, I’m enjoying being a mother far more than I ever imagined. Being mom to Taimur is probably the most sacred thing in my life. Hope I can be a good one. The journey has just started…Q. Who’s your go-to when it comes to ‘mommy advice’?Actually, I don’t go to anyone. I pretty much want the experience to be my own. You live and learn. Saif tells me please don’t listen to anyone. There are 10 different views and every mother operates differently from the other. So, I listen to everyone but I do my own thing.-By Kinnari Rathod</td>\n",

       "      <td>Did you know that Stanford University’s most popular class isn’t computer science? Nope, that would be a class called ‘Design Your Life’; and it highlights the importance of our personal well-being more than materialistic desires.It’s not the same thing as a New Year resolution. Resolution carries with it a burden that weighs us down. So, let’s begin with the first quarter of 2018 with ‘design’. Author Michael Hyatt who wrote the book, Your Best Year Ever: A 5-Step Plan for Achieving Your Most Important Goals, says all one needs is “the right approach” to design a new year. “Remember your life’s purpose with lower stress, and start designing your future, i.e., knowing how we want all the (specific) variables (of our goals) to fit together in the first place. But don’t be a drifter, be intentional,” says Hyatt, adding that we can only change our future, not our past. And therein lies the beauty of planning/design.GOAL-CENTRIC QUESTIONSAsk yourself: How do you want to feel at the end of 2018? What do you want to see happening at your workfront? How can you fix your health? The more specific the question, the more concrete will be your path to change.Technological enslavement has made sure we live in patterns, i.e., follow the same routine on an everyday basis, and wind up leading a muted, sedated, passive life. Thus, it’s mandatory for us to have a tool box handy to ‘design’ our lives. Life coach and author of Life Is a Do-Over: You Can Choose a New Path in Life, Cindy Clemens, urges us all to wake up from our ‘autopilot mode’. “Begin by creating your life compass, it will give a specific direction to your life. Make a focus list. Be curious and passionate,” she says. It’s the same point author Jen Sincero makes in her book, You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life. She says, “If you want to live a life you’ve never lived, you have to do things you’ve never done.”EASY-TO-APPLY CHANGESSays Archana Sardana, skydiver and mountaineer, “A life plan has to be implemented with easy experiments, where you are ‘doing’ the stuff on the blueprint of your goals. Experimentation is critical.”Clemens asks people to find the sweet spot between creating a great life and actually being present for these delicious moments of your life. A regular journalling practice can be a great way observe and process this creation. “I love to find a great place to go to and journal, be it the local coffee house, a park bench, or even a short walk in nature. I spend about 15 minutes reflecting on what has been showing up in my life and what steps I took,” she explains.INVEST IN 'SUPER CARE' NOT CARAuthor Rolf Dobelli, who wrote The Art of the Good Life, explains, “Every now and then, your life could be upturned. And there’s always a silent revolution that takes place within fields of thought. That’s why we need a mental toolkit from which we can draw different tools every now and then to move forward.” He urges people to “invest in building a mental fortress, not a Porsche collection, or, invest in super care, not supercar”. And while at it, identify the tasks that suck your energies like daily commute, paying bills etc. and experiment with ways to minimise their impact on your moods. Once undue stresses are removed from life, it’s easier to look at long-term goals that are achievable.How can you DESIGN 2018?- Discover WHY you want your year to be powerful: The power of your WHY is what motivates you through the gruelling, mundane and laborious tasks. All the ‘hows’ in life will be meaningless until your ‘whys’ are powerful enough.- Here’s the secret of goal-setting. You only see, experience and get what you look for. If you don’t know what to look for, you certainly won’t get it.- When you define your goals, you give your brain something to focus on and look for. You give your mind a new set of eyes to see all the people, circumstances, conversations, resources and ideas. It automatically broadens your horizons.- Expectation manifests into creation, i.e., it is what we expect that determines what we create in our lives.- Don’t just THINK it – INK it: The weakest ink is stronger than the strongest mind. Unless you write down your goals, they are often lost in the shuffle and excitement of new problems.- Start living with audacity. Have chutzpah. Stand away from the crowd. Don’t follow the herd any longer.Source: Darren Hardy,Living Your Best Year Ever- Post less stuff on social media- Focus on your inner scorecard, not outer.- Don’t believe in your own self-importance. This is one of the most valuable strategies for a good life.Source: Rolf Dobelli,The Art Of the Good LifeEvery year, my blueprint of what I want to do changes. From writing, I moved to working creatively with food. While designing your life, keep things simple and be in pursuit of calming pleasures that contribute to peace of mind— Sadia Dehlvi, author, food connoisseurRachel Roy, fashion designer and author of 'Design Your Life: Creating Success Through Personal Style', says what she chooses to wear affects not just her self-esteem but also the energy she puts out into the Universe.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Complex and contemplative in equal parts, ultra violet is often associated with mindfulness practices. A reason why you are likely to spot purple-toned lighting in meditative spaces. The colour is said to fill people with energy and positivity and inspire connection. Why not embrace the hue to bring some happiness and tranquility into your home?UV waysDecor expert Astha Khetan says that ultra violet adds a certain depth to a space. Whether you are using a statement pillow, painting, accent wall, a few sprigs of lilac or a vintage rug – a simple touch of the magical hue is all you need to transform your space. Her advice: “The easiest way to start decorating with a new colour is to take baby steps and not go overboard.”Ultra violet, with its bold and vivid blue, is a perfect match with raw materials such as concrete and natural wood. For statement corners, try ultra violet in different combinations; with sage green, lemon yellow, or vermillion. “In small spaces, avoid using ultra violet vertically like in curtains and walls. Use in small accessories on floor and below eye level,” suggests decor expert Vaishnavi Pratima. In large spaces, experiment with walls in ultra violet juxtaposed against contrasting furniture.— Additional inputs from decor expert Anuja JoshiHow to go UV?Pick jewel tones for a strong visual punch. But the idea is to make an impact without being garishMake sure your colours stay sophisticated by choosing shades from the same family that are not all too brightMix dark and romantic purple with other super-saturated dark colours and rich fabrics like velvetUse flowers like pansies, iris, phlox, hydrangea, petunia, verbenas, freesia, and columbinUse vases made in violet assortmentA tricky hue for homes, if you play it right UV can be the pop of colour that your house needs.Violet can be used in dining couture too.

       "0  Q. You carried your pregnancy with élan and seemed to enjoy every bit of it...(Smiles) I’m sure a lot of models and actors in our country — and in the West — have done this as well. But probably, there hasn’t been a commercial actress, who’s not taken a sabbatical. But pregnancy is the most normal thing. I was excited about starting a family and I wanted to share my joy with my family, friends and fans. So, there was nothing to hide. Even the fact that I had gained some weight. I put on most of my weight during my last trimester; that was also something I celebrated. Every woman puts on weight and enjoys that period in her life. I’ve also enjoyed hitting the gym and losing weight, which has been rejuvenating in a way. So I’ve just done exactly as I pleased. Having said that, it’s not that I’m setting an example or any such thing.Q. You had no qualms about posting newborn Taimur’s photograph on social media...In today’s times, everyone is seen and is out there. You post pictures on Instagram, on Facebook... because you want to share your life with people.When I was pregnant, both Saif and I had spoken about this and how we’d handle it. He was like there’s nothing to hide. He’s our child and this is the way it’s going to be. He’s going to be photographed, so be it. It’s convenient for stars when they want to be clicked... like at events, while putting on make-up, wearing an outfit... and so on. So, why hide your child? We’re pretty open and clear about it.Q. Taimur Ali Khan’s paparazzi’s favourite…(Laughs) I do understand that. But I just don’t want him to be looked upon as a star-kid. I want him to grow up as normally as possible. I want to let him be just the way he is.Q. Your presence on social media is huge even though you are not on it. When will Kareena Kapoor Khan join the bandwagon?I’m probably more on Instagram than anyone else. My pictures are everywhere. Then I don’t need to constantly be on it, na? My sister (Karisma Kapoor) posts my pictures; my friends put my pictures… My fan clubs have kept me alive. So I don’t have to actively be out there. I guess, Saif and I aren’t cut out for being on social media. Though we’re social.Q. You stepped out for dinner just a couple of days after giving birth, post which there were some unsavoury reactions. Did it bother you?I believe it’s foolish for people to even think in this manner. Giving birth is probably the most normal thing. It’s part of life. I’ve so many friends in America, who give birth and resume work within three days because they have no option. They don’t have a battalion of nurses or nannies looking after their kid.So the concept of having to be at home and sinking into postpartum depression is not required. Even if you’re a breast-feeding mother, you can pump the milk and put it in the feeding bottle for your baby. I don’t want to give any explanations but breast-feeding can be done in different ways.If I stepped out with my husband for an hour that’s also part of the joy of being parents, of being in a happy state of mind to return home to be with your child. Saif and I have never followed norms. And we’re going to be doing what we feel right and convinced about.Q. What kind of a mother are you – chilled or hyper?Since I’m a first time mother, I’m obviously quite hyper. I don’t want to miss out on anything while he’s growing. I wish to be there all the time. I’m loving the journey each day as it unfolds something new. And of course, I’m enjoying being a mother far more than I ever imagined. Being mom to Taimur is probably the most sacred thing in my life. Hope I can be a good one. The journey has just started…Q. Who’s your go-to when it comes to ‘mommy advice’?Actually, I don’t go to anyone. I pretty much want the experience to be my own. You live and learn. Saif tells me please don’t listen to anyone. There are 10 different views and every mother operates differently from the other. So, I listen to everyone but I do my own thing.-By Kinnari Rathod                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \n",

       "2  Did you know that Stanford University’s most popular class isn’t computer science? Nope, that would be a class called ‘Design Your Life’; and it highlights the importance of our personal well-being more than materialistic desires.It’s not the same thing as a New Year resolution. Resolution carries with it a burden that weighs us down. So, let’s begin with the first quarter of 2018 with ‘design’. Author Michael Hyatt who wrote the book, Your Best Year Ever: A 5-Step Plan for Achieving Your Most Important Goals, says all one needs is “the right approach” to design a new year. “Remember your life’s purpose with lower stress, and start designing your future, i.e., knowing how we want all the (specific) variables (of our goals) to fit together in the first place. But don’t be a drifter, be intentional,” says Hyatt, adding that we can only change our future, not our past. And therein lies the beauty of planning/design.GOAL-CENTRIC QUESTIONSAsk yourself: How do you want to feel at the end of 2018? What do you want to see happening at your workfront? How can you fix your health? The more specific the question, the more concrete will be your path to change.Technological enslavement has made sure we live in patterns, i.e., follow the same routine on an everyday basis, and wind up leading a muted, sedated, passive life. Thus, it’s mandatory for us to have a tool box handy to ‘design’ our lives. Life coach and author of Life Is a Do-Over: You Can Choose a New Path in Life, Cindy Clemens, urges us all to wake up from our ‘autopilot mode’. “Begin by creating your life compass, it will give a specific direction to your life. Make a focus list. Be curious and passionate,” she says. It’s the same point author Jen Sincero makes in her book, You Are a Badass: How to Stop Doubting Your Greatness and Start Living an Awesome Life. She says, “If you want to live a life you’ve never lived, you have to do things you’ve never done.”EASY-TO-APPLY CHANGESSays Archana Sardana, skydiver and mountaineer, “A life plan has to be implemented with easy experiments, where you are ‘doing’ the stuff on the blueprint of your goals. Experimentation is critical.”Clemens asks people to find the sweet spot between creating a great life and actually being present for these delicious moments of your life. A regular journalling practice can be a great way observe and process this creation. “I love to find a great place to go to and journal, be it the local coffee house, a park bench, or even a short walk in nature. I spend about 15 minutes reflecting on what has been showing up in my life and what steps I took,” she explains.INVEST IN 'SUPER CARE' NOT CARAuthor Rolf Dobelli, who wrote The Art of the Good Life, explains, “Every now and then, your life could be upturned. And there’s always a silent revolution that takes place within fields of thought. That’s why we need a mental toolkit from which we can draw different tools every now and then to move forward.” He urges people to “invest in building a mental fortress, not a Porsche collection, or, invest in super care, not supercar”. And while at it, identify the tasks that suck your energies like daily commute, paying bills etc. and experiment with ways to minimise their impact on your moods. Once undue stresses are removed from life, it’s easier to look at long-term goals that are achievable.How can you DESIGN 2018?- Discover WHY you want your year to be powerful: The power of your WHY is what motivates you through the gruelling, mundane and laborious tasks. All the ‘hows’ in life will be meaningless until your ‘whys’ are powerful enough.- Here’s the secret of goal-setting. You only see, experience and get what you look for. If you don’t know what to look for, you certainly won’t get it.- When you define your goals, you give your brain something to focus on and look for. You give your mind a new set of eyes to see all the people, circumstances, conversations, resources and ideas. It automatically broadens your horizons.- Expectation manifests into creation, i.e., it is what we expect that determines what we create in our lives.- Don’t just THINK it – INK it: The weakest ink is stronger than the strongest mind. Unless you write down your goals, they are often lost in the shuffle and excitement of new problems.- Start living with audacity. Have chutzpah. Stand away from the crowd. Don’t follow the herd any longer.Source: Darren Hardy,Living Your Best Year Ever- Post less stuff on social media- Focus on your inner scorecard, not outer.- Don’t believe in your own self-importance. This is one of the most valuable strategies for a good life.Source: Rolf Dobelli,The Art Of the Good LifeEvery year, my blueprint of what I want to do changes. From writing, I moved to working creatively with food. While designing your life, keep things simple and be in pursuit of calming pleasures that contribute to peace of mind— Sadia Dehlvi, author, food connoisseurRachel Roy, fashion designer and author of 'Design Your Life: Creating Success Through Personal Style', says what she chooses to wear affects not just her self-esteem but also the energy she puts out into the Universe.  \n",

       "4  Complex and contemplative in equal parts, ultra violet is often associated with mindfulness practices. A reason why you are likely to spot purple-toned lighting in meditative spaces. The colour is said to fill people with energy and positivity and inspire connection. Why not embrace the hue to bring some happiness and tranquility into your home?UV waysDecor expert Astha Khetan says that ultra violet adds a certain depth to a space. Whether you are using a statement pillow, painting, accent wall, a few sprigs of lilac or a vintage rug – a simple touch of the magical hue is all you need to transform your space. Her advice: “The easiest way to start decorating with a new colour is to take baby steps and not go overboard.”Ultra violet, with its bold and vivid blue, is a perfect match with raw materials such as concrete and natural wood. For statement corners, try ultra violet in different combinations; with sage green, lemon yellow, or vermillion. “In small spaces, avoid using ultra violet vertically like in curtains and walls. Use in small accessories on floor and below eye level,” suggests decor expert Vaishnavi Pratima. In large spaces, experiment with walls in ultra violet juxtaposed against contrasting furniture.— Additional inputs from decor expert Anuja JoshiHow to go UV?Pick jewel tones for a strong visual punch.

       "      <td>Sijoy Varghese, who recently stepped into Bollywood through Siddharth Malhotra-starrer Gentleman: Sundar, Susheel, Risky, is one of the few actors who have acted with both Dulquer Salmaan and Pranav Mohanlal.His upcoming Malayalam project Aadhi had him extensively working with Pranav, who is making his debut as a hero with the Jeethu Joseph directorial.Sijoy says that working with Pranav was fun. “I found him to be a real-life Charlie! His passion for travel, music and books is amazing and as we talk, I am sure he might be scaling the Himalayas or enjoying the peace at Manasarovar,” says Sijoy.The actor is also all praise for Pranav’s simplicity. “Maybe it’s because we are aware of the stature he enjoys in the industry in spite of which he remains a down-to-earth personality,” he says.Charlie, the character played by Dulquer in the eponymous movie, isn’t the only similarity that Sijoy found in the two star kids. “I was also impressed watching Pranav pull-off daring stunts sans dupe, just like how Dulquer took up bike stunts all by himself in Bangalore Days,” he says. “Also, on the sets, you would always see Pranav playing a guitar and singing.”Sijoy, who was also part of Kunchacko Boban’s latest release and Aadu 2, plays a well-to-do businessman named Sidharth in Aadhi. “He is quite shrewd and is based out of Bengaluru. As opposed to the usual salt and pepper look, I will be sporting jet-black hair in the film,” he reveals.The actor is also part of Mammootty’s Parole, directed by Sharrath Sandith. “I play Mammootty’s brother-in-law, a Pala-based achayan,” he says. Sijoy is also debuting in Telugu soon and hints it would be in a major project featuring a superstar. “I play an underworld don in the film and it feels great to try yet another industry, after Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi. I hope that I enjoy Telugu as much as I do the other three languages,” signs off Sijoy.</td>\n",

       "2  Sijoy Varghese, who recently stepped into Bollywood through Siddharth Malhotra-starrer Gentleman: Sundar, Susheel, Risky, is one of the few actors who have acted with both Dulquer Salmaan and Pranav Mohanlal.His upcoming Malayalam project Aadhi had him extensively working with Pranav, who is making his debut as a hero with the Jeethu Joseph directorial.Sijoy says that working with Pranav was fun. “I found him to be a real-life Charlie! His passion for travel, music and books is amazing and as we talk, I am sure he might be scaling the Himalayas or enjoying the peace at Manasarovar,” says Sijoy.The actor is also all praise for Pranav’s simplicity. “Maybe it’s because we are aware of the stature he enjoys in the industry in spite of which he remains a down-to-earth personality,” he says.Charlie, the character played by Dulquer in the eponymous movie, isn’t the only similarity that Sijoy found in the two star kids. “I was also impressed watching Pranav pull-off daring stunts sans dupe, just like how Dulquer took up bike stunts all by himself in Bangalore Days,” he says. “Also, on the sets, you would always see Pranav playing a guitar and singing.”Sijoy, who was also part of Kunchacko Boban’s latest release and Aadu 2, plays a well-to-do businessman named Sidharth in Aadhi. “He is quite shrewd and is based out of Bengaluru. As opposed to the usual salt and pepper look, I will be sporting jet-black hair in the film,” he reveals.The actor is also part of Mammootty’s Parole, directed by Sharrath Sandith. “I play Mammootty’s brother-in-law, a Pala-based achayan,” he says. Sijoy is also debuting in Telugu soon and hints it would be in a major project featuring a superstar. “I play an underworld don in the film and it feels great to try yet another industry, after Malayalam, Tamil and Hindi. I hope that I enjoy Telugu as much as I do the other three languages,” signs off Sijoy.  \n",

       "      <td>Fire broke out in the wee hours of Monday morning at a city bar in Kalasipalya, which claimed the lives of five employees who were asleep at the premises. While the cause of the blaze and other details are being investigated, the incident raises concern over safety precautions that Bengaluru bars adopt. In the process of quick business and lucrative incentives, many restaurants, cafés and bars offer their premises as makeshift sleeping areas for their staff. Given that the kitchens have inflammable equipment along with alcohol as well, this makes one wonder whether the problem is more than what meets the eye.Former local National Restaurant Association of India head and restaurateur Ashish Kothare cites rule 13 from The Karnataka Excise License (General Conditions) Rules 1967. “It states, ‘the licensee shall not allow any person other than a member of his family or his authorized servant in the shop during nights after the time fixed for closing the shop’. It clearly states that one cannot make their staff stay in these establishments daily, unless there is some work required,” says Ashish.An industry expert and restaurateur, on the basis of anonymyity, tells us, “While there is the obvious flouting of rules, there is another angle that needs to be considered. This has happened in an area like Kalasipalya and these bars and restaurants there are open usually at unearthly hours to cater to the labour class. These daily wage labourers, who wait there in the hope of being picked up by contractors, drink a lot to get themselves in the frame of mind to do the mammoth work they are subjected to. Most of these venues do their best business between 5 am and 7 am, when the labourers want to drink before their day begins. This is something that needs to be looked into as well.”Two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized: NRAIRahul Singh, President, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), says, “Members of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) adhere to the fire norms and timelines as prescribed by the state or city. The last shift crew follows the closing check list which constitutes stock take, clean up, prepare tables for next day, sequential shut down of equipment, checking the fire panel, among others. The restaurant is then locked up. Sleeping in the premises is not permitted. Restaurants, by their essentiality of open flames in kitchen, hot equipment, electrical connections, cooking oils, cleaning chemicals, paper product and furniture, have all the ingredients for a fire to flame out of control. Fire protection deals with prevention, while fire fighting deals with cure in case of fire. Poor fire protection leads to necessity of fire fighting service. One cannot exist without the other. Unfortunately, two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized and susceptible to flouting norms, whichtarnishes the image of the entire sector.”BBMP’s pre-emptive act in 2018Last week, in wake of the Mumbai fire incident at a buzzing hotspot that claimed lives, the BBMP issued notices to over 60 spaces, which mainlyincluded rooftop arenas, citing violation of fire safety norms. City Mayor Sampath Raj was also quoted as saying that some rooftops had flammablematerial and that all of them had violated fire safety measuresKJ George: Minister for Bengaluru Development and State Town Planning tweeted:Visited Kailash Bar &amp; Restaurant in Kalasipalyam, where fire broke out last night. Announced 5 lakh compensation for kin of those who lost their lives in the fire.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Actors across the world have shown a penchant for being in the public eye and ‘serving society’ by running for office. In India, especially in the South, has also been at the forefront of it, with most states having been run by an erstwhile actor as Chief Minister. So, it is not surprising if your favourite star joins a popular party, or launches his/her own, as has been the case in recent times with Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Upendra. We asked the youth, the backbone of the country, if being in showbiz qualifies actors to work for society...FORActors should be encouraged to venture into fields like politics. The nature of their work and lifestyle could mean that they remain unaware of everyday realities in different parts of the country, but the influence and reach of these personalities must be kept in mind. As people who have unwavering support and loyalty among fans, it is imperative to understand that the positive policies undertaken by actors will definitely be beneficial in the long run because of public backing — Saurav K, 2nd year, BBA, CMS Jain UniversityActors are, at the end of the day, ordinary people like us and should be allowed to explore whatever avenues they wish. As long as their intentions are right and just, politics is a great option for actors. They make great role models and they already have huge fan bases, which is sure to make them successful public figures in the political sphere. If they can make good use of their position and power, society will greatly benefit from their endeavours. As long as they take measured and responsible decisions, actors will make great politicians — Gokul V, student of Chartered Accountancy, JK Shaw InstituteAn actor will definitely know how to ‘act’, be it onscreen or off it . Mixing these two seemingly ominous fields could lead to a better India. Actors are used to the limelight, and they probably could, all things considered, handle the pressure better. I’d say act-ions speak louder than words — Aparajit Radhakrishna, 4th semester, Media Studies, Christ UniversityAGAINSTMovie stars live in a world of make-believe, where they sell dreams to masses. Unfortunately, the cult of hero-worshipping and fandom distances them from ground realities over a period of time. They lack the required organizational and administrative skills to be effective in public administration. They should avoid getting into the world of politics for these reasons — Oorvi Umesh, 2nd year, MES College of Arts, Commerce and ScienceNo, they should not, because actors live in their own bubble and may not really understand the day-to-day problems people. They may find it hard to connect with the lower strata of society and, hence, cannot be a voice for them. Also, a large part of their following would just go with anything they say because of their celebrity status; I’m not sure how many people would oppose their favourite star, if the need be. It is, after all, an important part of any democratic process — Vidya Viswanathan, 3rd year, Home Science, Mount Carmel CollegePoliticians might make good actors, but actors do not always make good politicians. The elections become a popularity contest instead of a decision-making process for citizens to elect the most deserving candidate who might not be as well known. In reality, actors are not always equipped with the knowledge or experience to hold a position of authority — Kallam Sashikala, 1st year, BA PYEE, Mount Carmel College-- Sanjana Sindhe</td>\n",

       "      <td>With their hearts beating faster, prayers on their lips and anxious looks on their faces, the students wait with bated breath for the results of their competitions, after showcasing their best; all the while, preparing themselves to face both failure and success.Once the results are announced, for the winners, there is a sudden rush of emotions – of joy and relief – as they rejoice with their family and friends. Flashes of camera and interviews follow. And for those who don’t make it to the top three, the platform becomes the best teacher for life as they accept failure saying that not everyone gets a prize and they should focus on the next task.Over the past five decades, the Kerala State Youth festival, the cultural extravaganza touted as Asia’s largest youth festival, has been a place where you saw tears of joy and disappointment under one roof. However, this aspect has been sorely missing at the ongoing edition at Thrissur, which has scrapped the practice of awarding first, second and third prizes and adopted a grading system with all participants being awarded a trophy.Though the organisers say that the decision was to curtail unhealthy competition, it has created a bigger mess, according to the participants, parents, teachers and previous years’ winners. The lukewarm response and disappointed faces of teachers and parents reflect the mood at the venues as they say that they are sure that their children will get an A grade anyway.Alappuzha resident Salahuddin Y, father of Asna S T, who earned an A grade for Ghazal, calls the grading system “an injustice to the kids”. “It will only make the mediocre and below average participants happy, and spoil the thrill of the festival. Though the idea that art is not for competition sounds nice, I strongly feel that the children should be given recognition by ranking first, second and third. I am an employee at the Public Service Commission Department and we cannot offer jobs to everyone who has applied. This is like the Malayalam proverb eliye pedichu illam chuduka.”The students are being the victims of the inefficiency of the system, fumes Silvastar MJ, a drawing teacher from Wayanad, whose students have been consistently winning at the festival for the past 18 years. He says that the grading system will only help the judges avoid attacks of parents and teachers.Silvastar adds, “The government has done a favour, especially to those who judge dance competitions. The judges would give everyone an A grade now and avoid chaos. We saw it happen with the Kathakali contest, where 11 out of the 12 teams got an A grade,” he says. “Now it isn’t a competition venue but just a platform to exhibit. However, even at exhibitions, there are prizes for the best stalls.”The youth festival has a history of discovering many talents such as Manju Warrier, Kavya Madhavan, G Venugopal, Sujatha, Navya Nair and Vineeth, who were the cream of the contestants.Salahuddin says that these opportunities will be denied to the students due to the revised system. “If our earlier system was faulty, how did we get amazing artistes from it? No matter how talented the students are, there will always be one or two who stand out. There were 18 A grades in higher secondary girls’ light music contest. What is the point of the competition now?” he asks.Supporting him, actress Ambili Devi, who won seven prizes at the 2001 fest, says, “I am not against grades as there will be many talents apart from the best three. Let them give an A grade to them but the best should be acknowledged. It is like you contest strongly at the school and district levels and then at the state level, everyone is considered equal. The government has probably adopted this to reduce appeals and other discrepancies, but I think those aspects shouldn’t come in the way of the spirit of youth festival.”The new system also deprives students the ability to handle failure, says 1996’s Kalaprathiba Dr Sreehari G K. “In every competition, there will be a best performer like in a marathon or a 100 metre race. The basic intention of a competition is to give the children an idea of success and failure and prepare them to face the future. In our time, we never felt those won were greater than those who didn’t as there was always a healthy competition, mutual respect and acceptance. Now in the name of stress, we are creating a lethargic generation who is incapable of handling minute stress,” he says.According to Silvastar, the stress and discrepancies are more prevalent at the lower levels. “A lot of politics happen at school levels and children are pressurised and even emotionally hurt. If it is about creating healthy competitions, the government should first monitor selection process of the youth festival at these levels,” he explains.Former winner and engineering student Amrutha S, from Palakad who has accompanied her sister Gopika for this year’s event, says the grading system takes away the charm of the fest. “I lost all interest the moment I heard about the revised manual,” she says. “There should be a winner. Only those who have been part of the previous fests and have won or lost will know the beauty of it. It is not just nostalgia, it was our first step to face the bigger world outside.”Echoing her views is BDS student Megha Muraleedaran from Malappuram who has also returned to the festival ground with good memories about late night competitions and camaraderie. “The standards may come down as the participants are aware that an average performance would fetch them an A grade. They may seem relaxed but I feel we will lose out on all the fun. What is a youth festival without winners? They have already removed Kalathilakam and Kalaprathiba title, now this too,” says Megha, who accompanied her sister, who participated in the Kathakali competition.However, there are a few who support the new system. Singer Vaishnav Girish, who earned two A grades in Ghazal and Urdu group song, says he believes the festival is just another stage performance. “I do not think we should look at it as competition. That is what my mother says. She tells me to go, enjoy and return. I think the grading system will make everyone happy,” he says.Agreeing with him, dancer teacher and actor Ramadevi says, “This will make the festival scam-free. We all know that a lot of corruption has been happening behind the scenes and most of the time the prizes didn’t go to those who deserved it. That will all change and the festival will become a creative fiesta.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>She is all of nine years old, but get her started on Kathakali and a young Vishrutha Vijayakumar speaks like a learned person with many years of experience.And indeed, the little girl has some solid experience in her kitty as an emerging young talent of the art form. The artiste from North Paravoor, who is a Class 4 student in Aura Global School, Kodungalloor, has performed Kathakali in more than 60 stages so far, and has even portrayed roles like Mathali of Kalakeyavadham, which are only done by experienced artistes.To have a profile like that, she did start very young. “I was introduced to Kathakali when I was in kindergarten and I remember those days in bits and pieces,” she says, adding, “My parents sent me to Kathakali class saying, ‘Why don’t you try it? If you like it, you can learn it.’ When I watched it, the colours, music and mudras appeared to be a lot of fun.”It was under her first guru Sathi Sreekumar that Vishrutha learned the basics of the art, vaithari, kaal sadhakam et al. She staged her arangettam when she was in Class 2 and over the years, she says, her love for the art form grew manifold as she learned more. “The various stories and aspects of Kathakali fascinate me every time I learn something new. My current guru, FACT Biju Bhaskar, is the one who taught me the stories of the art form,” she says. Vishrutha has portrayed a variety of characters like Krishnan, Prahladan and more, but wants to do more of kathi veshams.“I am now learning the young Ravanan’s character in Ravanotbhavam,” Vishrutha says, adding that playing Mathali was another memorable experience. “I don’t think anyone my age has previously performed Mathali on stage. It’s done by senior artistes, and that gives me immense pride.”On her favourite performers of the art form, she says, “Kalamandalam Gopi aasan used to be my favourite till some time ago. Now, I like my guruji’s performances better because his veshabhangi is incomparable and kathi veshams are superb. When he plays women characters, for instance, you wouldn’t know the difference, despite him being a man. I too want to try out some female roles soon, like those in Duryodhanavadham,” Vishrutha says.The young artiste’s talent isn’t limited to Kathakali alone but also finds time to learn Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam and Kuchipudi under R L V Unnikrishnan, Dr Neena Prasad and Sreelakshmi Govardhan, respectively. How easy is it for her to manage school, along with all of these trainings? “We have a lot to study at school too. Sometimes, I study from 7 pm to 12 pm, especially during examination times, to compensate for lost hours,” she exclaims.However, Vishrutha is yet to showcase Kathakali at school. “I have only performed dance at school. My friends never recognise me in my Kathakali make-up, when they see photographs or programmes. ‘Is that really you, Vishrutha?’ they ask me. I don’t think even an ounce of my casual look gets retained when I put on the Kathakali make-up,” she says.Of late, Vishrutha has also stepped into the world of cinema. She is part of a children’s film titled Papas, directed by Sampath. “I play a character named Meenu in the film, who lived around 1984. She is nine years old and is the girlfriend of the lead character,” Vishrutha says.Will she continue with Kathakali when she grows up? “My dream is to be an established Kathakali artiste. At times, my mom says in jest why not become a doctor, but I guess my parents also want me to be an artiste,” she says.Vishrutha’s parents, Vijayakumar and Sindhu, are settled in North Paravoor. Her mom Sindhu says, “We didn’t get her interested in these art forms for anything else, but to make her a good artiste. However, she is too young to figure it all out now. If she grows up and decides to be a meritorious artiste, we would consider that a great achievement.”</td>\n",

He was completely fine with it,” says Vimal.However, the Ennu Ninte Moideen director says that Vikram had his doubts when he had initially approached him for the movie based on the character in Mahabharatha.“When I first contacted him on phone, Vikram was sceptical. That’s because in Tamil, Sivaji Ganesan had played Karnan and in Telugu there was an epic film by NT Rama Rao titled Daana Veera Soora Karna. So, he wanted to know how this film was going to be different,” he says.This prompted the director to meet the actor in person and narrate the screenplay, which he has been working for the past three years.“Once he heard the script narration and understood the in-depth research for it, he was convinced. Also, we will be using cutting edge technology to recreate this period,” says Vimal.Apart from Vikram, the movie will have several stars from different film industries with “major Hollywood actor playing Bhima,” says Vimal, adding that Dangal’s casting director Mukesh Chhabra is also part of the movie.While Vikram is no stranger to transforming his body to suit the character, this film too will have him pushing his limits to play the warrior. “He has already started working out and will be trained by international action choreographers abroad for the war sequences of the film,” says the filmmaker.Mahavir Karna, which will be made in Hindi and released in other languages, will go on floors in October 2018 and is expected to release by December 2019. The movie will be shot in Niagara waterfalls in Canada, Hyderabad and Jaipur.</td>\n",

       "0  Fire broke out in the wee hours of Monday morning at a city bar in Kalasipalya, which claimed the lives of five employees who were asleep at the premises. While the cause of the blaze and other details are being investigated, the incident raises concern over safety precautions that Bengaluru bars adopt. In the process of quick business and lucrative incentives, many restaurants, cafés and bars offer their premises as makeshift sleeping areas for their staff. Given that the kitchens have inflammable equipment along with alcohol as well, this makes one wonder whether the problem is more than what meets the eye.Former local National Restaurant Association of India head and restaurateur Ashish Kothare cites rule 13 from The Karnataka Excise License (General Conditions) Rules 1967. “It states, ‘the licensee shall not allow any person other than a member of his family or his authorized servant in the shop during nights after the time fixed for closing the shop’. It clearly states that one cannot make their staff stay in these establishments daily, unless there is some work required,” says Ashish.An industry expert and restaurateur, on the basis of anonymyity, tells us, “While there is the obvious flouting of rules, there is another angle that needs to be considered. This has happened in an area like Kalasipalya and these bars and restaurants there are open usually at unearthly hours to cater to the labour class. These daily wage labourers, who wait there in the hope of being picked up by contractors, drink a lot to get themselves in the frame of mind to do the mammoth work they are subjected to. Most of these venues do their best business between 5 am and 7 am, when the labourers want to drink before their day begins. This is something that needs to be looked into as well.”Two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized: NRAIRahul Singh, President, National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), says, “Members of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) adhere to the fire norms and timelines as prescribed by the state or city. The last shift crew follows the closing check list which constitutes stock take, clean up, prepare tables for next day, sequential shut down of equipment, checking the fire panel, among others. The restaurant is then locked up. Sleeping in the premises is not permitted. Restaurants, by their essentiality of open flames in kitchen, hot equipment, electrical connections, cooking oils, cleaning chemicals, paper product and furniture, have all the ingredients for a fire to flame out of control. Fire protection deals with prevention, while fire fighting deals with cure in case of fire. Poor fire protection leads to necessity of fire fighting service. One cannot exist without the other. Unfortunately, two-thirds of the food services industry remains unorganized and susceptible to flouting norms, whichtarnishes the image of the entire sector.”BBMP’s pre-emptive act in 2018Last week, in wake of the Mumbai fire incident at a buzzing hotspot that claimed lives, the BBMP issued notices to over 60 spaces, which mainlyincluded rooftop arenas, citing violation of fire safety norms.

       "1  Actors across the world have shown a penchant for being in the public eye and ‘serving society’ by running for office. In India, especially in the South, has also been at the forefront of it, with most states having been run by an erstwhile actor as Chief Minister. So, it is not surprising if your favourite star joins a popular party, or launches his/her own, as has been the case in recent times with Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Upendra. We asked the youth, the backbone of the country, if being in showbiz qualifies actors to work for society...FORActors should be encouraged to venture into fields like politics. The nature of their work and lifestyle could mean that they remain unaware of everyday realities in different parts of the country, but the influence and reach of these personalities must be kept in mind. As people who have unwavering support and loyalty among fans, it is imperative to understand that the positive policies undertaken by actors will definitely be beneficial in the long run because of public backing — Saurav K, 2nd year, BBA, CMS Jain UniversityActors are, at the end of the day, ordinary people like us and should be allowed to explore whatever avenues they wish. As long as their intentions are right and just, politics is a great option for actors. They make great role models and they already have huge fan bases, which is sure to make them successful public figures in the political sphere. If they can make good use of their position and power, society will greatly benefit from their endeavours. As long as they take measured and responsible decisions, actors will make great politicians — Gokul V, student of Chartered Accountancy, JK Shaw InstituteAn actor will definitely know how to ‘act’, be it onscreen or off it . Mixing these two seemingly ominous fields could lead to a better India. Actors are used to the limelight, and they probably could, all things considered, handle the pressure better. I’d say act-ions speak louder than words — Aparajit Radhakrishna, 4th semester, Media Studies, Christ UniversityAGAINSTMovie stars live in a world of make-believe, where they sell dreams to masses. Unfortunately, the cult of hero-worshipping and fandom distances them from ground realities over a period of time. They lack the required organizational and administrative skills to be effective in public administration. They should avoid getting into the world of politics for these reasons — Oorvi Umesh, 2nd year, MES College of Arts, Commerce and ScienceNo, they should not, because actors live in their own bubble and may not really understand the day-to-day problems people. They may find it hard to connect with the lower strata of society and, hence, cannot be a voice for them. Also, a large part of their following would just go with anything they say because of their celebrity status; I’m not sure how many people would oppose their favourite star, if the need be. It is, after all, an important part of any democratic process — Vidya Viswanathan, 3rd year, Home Science, Mount Carmel CollegePoliticians might make good actors, but actors do not always make good politicians. The elections become a popularity contest instead of a decision-making process for citizens to elect the most deserving candidate who might not be as well known. In reality, actors are not always equipped with the knowledge or experience to hold a position of authority — Kallam Sashikala, 1st year, BA PYEE, Mount Carmel College-- Sanjana Sindhe                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "2  With their hearts beating faster, prayers on their lips and anxious looks on their faces, the students wait with bated breath for the results of their competitions, after showcasing their best; all the while, preparing themselves to face both failure and success.Once the results are announced, for the winners, there is a sudden rush of emotions – of joy and relief – as they rejoice with their family and friends. Flashes of camera and interviews follow. And for those who don’t make it to the top three, the platform becomes the best teacher for life as they accept failure saying that not everyone gets a prize and they should focus on the next task.Over the past five decades, the Kerala State Youth festival, the cultural extravaganza touted as Asia’s largest youth festival, has been a place where you saw tears of joy and disappointment under one roof. However, this aspect has been sorely missing at the ongoing edition at Thrissur, which has scrapped the practice of awarding first, second and third prizes and adopted a grading system with all participants being awarded a trophy.Though the organisers say that the decision was to curtail unhealthy competition, it has created a bigger mess, according to the participants, parents, teachers and previous years’ winners. The lukewarm response and disappointed faces of teachers and parents reflect the mood at the venues as they say that they are sure that their children will get an A grade anyway.Alappuzha resident Salahuddin Y, father of Asna S T, who earned an A grade for Ghazal, calls the grading system “an injustice to the kids”. “It will only make the mediocre and below average participants happy, and spoil the thrill of the festival. Though the idea that art is not for competition sounds nice, I strongly feel that the children should be given recognition by ranking first, second and third. I am an employee at the Public Service Commission Department and we cannot offer jobs to everyone who has applied. This is like the Malayalam proverb eliye pedichu illam chuduka.”The students are being the victims of the inefficiency of the system, fumes Silvastar MJ, a drawing teacher from Wayanad, whose students have been consistently winning at the festival for the past 18 years. He says that the grading system will only help the judges avoid attacks of parents and teachers.Silvastar adds, “The government has done a favour, especially to those who judge dance competitions. The judges would give everyone an A grade now and avoid chaos. We saw it happen with the Kathakali contest, where 11 out of the 12 teams got an A grade,” he says. “Now it isn’t a competition venue but just a platform to exhibit. However, even at exhibitions, there are prizes for the best stalls.”The youth festival has a history of discovering many talents such as Manju Warrier, Kavya Madhavan, G Venugopal, Sujatha, Navya Nair and Vineeth, who were the cream of the contestants.Salahuddin says that these opportunities will be denied to the students due to the revised system. “If our earlier system was faulty, how did we get amazing artistes from it? No matter how talented the students are, there will always be one or two who stand out. There were 18 A grades in higher secondary girls’ light music contest. What is the point of the competition now?” he asks.Supporting him, actress Ambili Devi, who won seven prizes at the 2001 fest, says, “I am not against grades as there will be many talents apart from the best three. Let them give an A grade to them but the best should be acknowledged. It is like you contest strongly at the school and district levels and then at the state level, everyone is considered equal. The government has probably adopted this to reduce appeals and other discrepancies, but I think those aspects shouldn’t come in the way of the spirit of youth festival.”The new system also deprives students the ability to handle failure, says 1996’s Kalaprathiba Dr Sreehari G K. “In every competition, there will be a best performer like in a marathon or a 100 metre race. The basic intention of a competition is to give the children an idea of success and failure and prepare them to face the future. In our time, we never felt those won were greater than those who didn’t as there was always a healthy competition, mutual respect and acceptance. Now in the name of stress, we are creating a lethargic generation who is incapable of handling minute stress,” he says.According to Silvastar, the stress and discrepancies are more prevalent at the lower levels. “A lot of politics happen at school levels and children are pressurised and even emotionally hurt. If it is about creating healthy competitions, the government should first monitor selection process of the youth festival at these levels,” he explains.Former winner and engineering student Amrutha S, from Palakad who has accompanied her sister Gopika for this year’s event, says the grading system takes away the charm of the fest. “I lost all interest the moment I heard about the revised manual,” she says. “There should be a winner. Only those who have been part of the previous fests and have won or lost will know the beauty of it. It is not just nostalgia, it was our first step to face the bigger world outside.”Echoing her views is BDS student Megha Muraleedaran from Malappuram who has also returned to the festival ground with good memories about late night competitions and camaraderie. “The standards may come down as the participants are aware that an average performance would fetch them an A grade. They may seem relaxed but I feel we will lose out on all the fun. What is a youth festival without winners? They have already removed Kalathilakam and Kalaprathiba title, now this too,” says Megha, who accompanied her sister, who participated in the Kathakali competition.However, there are a few who support the new system. Singer Vaishnav Girish, who earned two A grades in Ghazal and Urdu group song, says he believes the festival is just another stage performance. “I do not think we should look at it as competition. That is what my mother says. She tells me to go, enjoy and return. I think the grading system will make everyone happy,” he says.Agreeing with him, dancer teacher and actor Ramadevi says, “This will make the festival scam-free. We all know that a lot of corruption has been happening behind the scenes and most of the time the prizes didn’t go to those who deserved it. That will all change and the festival will become a creative fiesta.”  \n",
       "3  She is all of nine years old, but get her started on Kathakali and a young Vishrutha Vijayakumar speaks like a learned person with many years of experience.And indeed, the little girl has some solid experience in her kitty as an emerging young talent of the art form. The artiste from North Paravoor, who is a Class 4 student in Aura Global School, Kodungalloor, has performed Kathakali in more than 60 stages so far, and has even portrayed roles like Mathali of Kalakeyavadham, which are only done by experienced artistes.To have a profile like that, she did start very young. “I was introduced to Kathakali when I was in kindergarten and I remember those days in bits and pieces,” she says, adding, “My parents sent me to Kathakali class saying, ‘Why don’t you try it? If you like it, you can learn it.’ When I watched it, the colours, music and mudras appeared to be a lot of fun.”It was under her first guru Sathi Sreekumar that Vishrutha learned the basics of the art, vaithari, kaal sadhakam et al. She staged her arangettam when she was in Class 2 and over the years, she says, her love for the art form grew manifold as she learned more. “The various stories and aspects of Kathakali fascinate me every time I learn something new. My current guru, FACT Biju Bhaskar, is the one who taught me the stories of the art form,” she says. Vishrutha has portrayed a variety of characters like Krishnan, Prahladan and more, but wants to do more of kathi veshams.“I am now learning the young Ravanan’s character in Ravanotbhavam,” Vishrutha says, adding that playing Mathali was another memorable experience. “I don’t think anyone my age has previously performed Mathali on stage. It’s done by senior artistes, and that gives me immense pride.”On her favourite performers of the art form, she says, “Kalamandalam Gopi aasan used to be my favourite till some time ago. Now, I like my guruji’s performances better because his veshabhangi is incomparable and kathi veshams are superb. When he plays women characters, for instance, you wouldn’t know the difference, despite him being a man. I too want to try out some female roles soon, like those in Duryodhanavadham,” Vishrutha says.The young artiste’s talent isn’t limited to Kathakali alone but also finds time to learn Bharatanatyam, Mohiniyattam and Kuchipudi under R L V Unnikrishnan, Dr Neena Prasad and Sreelakshmi Govardhan, respectively. How easy is it for her to manage school, along with all of these trainings? “We have a lot to study at school too. Sometimes, I study from 7 pm to 12 pm, especially during examination times, to compensate for lost hours,” she exclaims.However, Vishrutha is yet to showcase Kathakali at school. “I have only performed dance at school. My friends never recognise me in my Kathakali make-up, when they see photographs or programmes. ‘Is that really you, Vishrutha?’ they ask me. I don’t think even an ounce of my casual look gets retained when I put on the Kathakali make-up,” she says.Of late, Vishrutha has also stepped into the world of cinema. She is part of a children’s film titled Papas, directed by Sampath. “I play a character named Meenu in the film, who lived around 1984. She is nine years old and is the girlfriend of the lead character,” Vishrutha says.Will she continue with Kathakali when she grows up? “My dream is to be an established Kathakali artiste. At times, my mom says in jest why not become a doctor, but I guess my parents also want me to be an artiste,” she says.Vishrutha’s parents, Vijayakumar and Sindhu, are settled in North Paravoor. Her mom Sindhu says, “We didn’t get her interested in these art forms for anything else, but to make her a good artiste. However, she is too young to figure it all out now. If she grows up and decides to be a meritorious artiste, we would consider that a great achievement.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "4  One of the major announcements this week was undoubtedly Chiyaan Vikram playing the role of Karna in Ennu Ninte Moideen director RS Vimal’s upcoming film, Mahavir Karna, which is touted to be made on a budget of Rs 300 crore.While Vimal had earlier announced the movie with Prithviraj, he says that the team changed their plans midway and opted for Vikram.“Prithviraj is busy with his directorial Lucifer and has other acting commitments for the next two years. By mid 2017, we had decided to scale up the project to an international level and had apprised Prithviraj of roping in Vikram. He was completely fine with it,” says Vimal.However, the Ennu Ninte Moideen director says that Vikram had his doubts when he had initially approached him for the movie based on the character in Mahabharatha.“When I first contacted him on phone, Vikram was sceptical. That’s because in Tamil, Sivaji Ganesan had played Karnan and in Telugu there was an epic film by NT Rama Rao titled Daana Veera Soora Karna. So, he wanted to know how this film was going to be different,” he says.This prompted the director to meet the actor in person and narrate the screenplay, which he has been working for the past three years.“Once he heard the script narration and understood the in-depth research for it, he was convinced. Also, we will be using cutting edge technology to recreate this period,” says Vimal.Apart from Vikram, the movie will have several stars from different film industries with “major Hollywood actor playing Bhima,” says Vimal, adding that Dangal’s casting director Mukesh Chhabra is also part of the movie.While Vikram is no stranger to transforming his body to suit the character, this film too will have him pushing his limits to play the warrior. “He has already started working out and will be trained by international action choreographers abroad for the war sequences of the film,” says the filmmaker.Mahavir Karna, which will be made in Hindi and released in other languages, will go on floors in October 2018 and is expected to release by December 2019. The movie will be shot in Niagara waterfalls in Canada, Hyderabad and Jaipur.

A section of students, including girls, reached the depot and sought the staff members to operate buses to enable them to attend college. As they did not get a positive response from the depot staff, they staged a road blockade on the Villupuram-Trichy national highway to vent their anger.A team of police and revenue officials rushed to the spot and held peace talks with the protesting students, who dispersed after the team members assured that they will take up the issue with the authorities concerned and arrange for buses before and after the college hours.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For years, our filmmakers have tried to come up with Tamil titles for their projects so that they can enjoy tax exemption. There have been several controversies around changing of titles in the last minute, too. Not to mention bizarre instances like that of the Udhayanidhi-starrer Manithan, which was denied an exemption after it was alleged that ‘Manithan’ was not a Tamil word. Almost a decade ago, there was the Kamal Haasan-starrer Mumbai Express, which had to face this issue, and it continued till recently, when films like Deal, Power Paandi, had to change their titles to introduce Tamil words like ‘Vaa’ Deal and ‘Pa’ Paandi, respectively.However, thanks to GST (though it had a different set of side-effect on industry, too), directors are now free to use any language for the title for their projects. And so, it is with great gusto that the industry is coming up with one aangila title after another. After all, a sleek English title adds to the smartness of the movie, you see. Or so they think...SketchThis Vikram-starrer will be one of the first big-budget ‘English-titled’ films to hit the screens post GST. Directed by Vijay Chander, this project was titled long before the verdict came out. Since the time the gangster drama got an official title, there were speculations of the makers going for a title change owing to the potential tax issue. The director had said that the title was chosen keeping in mind the popularity of the word ‘sketch’ among gangsters in North Madras, on whom the movie was made. However, the makers stuck to their decision, and the GST changes only came as a relief to the makers.PartyThe title of this film was announced a few days before GST came into existence. The announcement was a surprise to movie buffs as the makers made it official during the audio launch of Gemini Ganesanum Suruli Rajanum. By the time the surprise regarding the project was revealed on stage, it was confirmed that Kollywood movies need not come up a with Tamil title anymore, though that was not necessarily the reason for them to opt for an English title. Interestingly, one of Venkat Prabhu’s earlier films, Mass, was changed to Massu Engira Masilamani due to the tax-exemption issue.Super DeluxeThiagarajan Kumararaja, who made the critically-acclaimed Aaranya Kaandam, is back to directing a film after more than six years. His film, which features a stellar cast, including the likes of Vijay Sethupathi, Fahadh Faasil, Samantha Akkineni among others, was initially titled as Aneethi Kathaigal. And then, the director surprised one and all by posting a picture of Sethupathi on Twitter a few months ago, along with this English title. And, a few days ago, he had posted a sneak peek of an intriguing sequence, which had Samantha in it, and reiterated that this is indeed the title of his film, through a tweet.BalloonThe horror film, which hit screens in December, was actually announced much earlier. Directed by Sinish and starring Jai, Anjali and Janani Iyer, the spooky film had a smooth release as it opened to the audience much later, post GST came into effect.LensOne of the acclaimed films of last year, the movie, which threw light on the darker side of technology growth, too, was a bilingual film. Earlier, even films that were dubbed from English or Telugu used to have Tamil titles. Lens, surprisingly, retained the title the makers used for its Malayalam version.SoloThis bilingual film was safe with regard to its title, thanks to its post-GST release. However, the film had to suffer due to the theatre strike proposed by Tamil Film Producers Council as a mark of protest against the local body entertainment tax.RUMThe heist film, which released almost a year ago (before GST), didn't run into any big issues. But the makers had once clarified that ‘rum’ is actually a Tamil word with a different meaning, and that the title has no connection with the alcoholic beverage.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The recent fire at an outlet in Kalasipalya, which claimed five lives, has caused a lot of concern for safety in restaurants in Bengaluru. But the Bengaluru Bruhat Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is not going to react in a hasty fashion. The commissioner, Manjunatha Prasad, spoke to us, saying that the BBMP is going to react to this situation in a patient and orderly manner. We quizzed him about some of the rumours that were floating around yesterday and he answered them patiently.“This is a fire incident and we are going to take into account what is recommended by the fire department. We will implement whatever changes or suggestions they give us. There is currently no reaction or release being issued from us,” says Manjunatha.Reacting to rumours that cafés and bars serving hookah will be asked to shut as they pose a fire threat, he says, “No such decision is being taken as of now by us.”As for the matter of notices issued to terrace cafés and lounges across the city earlier this month, he adds, “Those were for a different reason. Most of them were operating on terraces without proper permits. We are issued notices, asking the establishments to get their together and acquire relevant permissions.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>There is a conflict in the system of the judiciary, legislature and executive that we are following in the country, which is one of the largest democracies in the world. Why are we taking so many decades to deliver a judgment on a subject that criminalizes one community? This is a constitutional crisis, as there is a law that is directly saying that one section is criminal under it.The historical Delhi High Court ruling of 2009 had actually given us a boost and the confidence to speak about what exactly we are standing for. But then, there was a sense of disappointment with the 2013 Supreme Court judgement, which overturned the HC ruling.What everyone fails to see is that it is not about same sex. The media has also been constantly highlighting ‘gay sex’, which is not the case. Section 377 definitively talks about human sexuality, but it is also about dignity. The law violates my right to privacy and dignity.In fact, when MP Shashi Tharoor introduced the Anti-Discrimination and Equality Bill in 2016 in the Lok Sabha, there was a discussion about homosexuality as well, and the way the members of the house behaved was appalling. Without understanding the legitimacy of the politics of sexuality, they made blind statements that literally undermined one identity, one sexuality and one marginalized community, which is us.Legislators have power and responsibility and they have to behave in that manner. Section 377 is direct violation against us. The Legislature and Executive have been playing an ‘impotent’ role in this matter, which is why we have knocked on the door of the judiciary. Over the years, there have been steps in the right direction and we are thankful to the court for that. In fact, if you look at the rulings of the present Chief Justice, be it in the case of the right to privacy, Aadhar or triple talaq, among others, they have been progressive, so we are hopeful that at least some bits of the section will be deleted, if not completely repealed.</td>\n",

As they did not get a positive response from the depot staff, they staged a road blockade on the Villupuram-Trichy national highway to vent their anger.A team of police and revenue officials rushed to the spot and held peace talks with the protesting students, who dispersed after the team members assured that they will take up the issue with the authorities concerned and arrange for buses before and after the college hours.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",
       "1  For years, our filmmakers have tried to come up with Tamil titles for their projects so that they can enjoy tax exemption. There have been several controversies around changing of titles in the last minute, too. Not to mention bizarre instances like that of the Udhayanidhi-starrer Manithan, which was denied an exemption after it was alleged that ‘Manithan’ was not a Tamil word. Almost a decade ago, there was the Kamal Haasan-starrer Mumbai Express, which had to face this issue, and it continued till recently, when films like Deal, Power Paandi, had to change their titles to introduce Tamil words like ‘Vaa’ Deal and ‘Pa’ Paandi, respectively.However, thanks to GST (though it had a different set of side-effect on industry, too), directors are now free to use any language for the title for their projects. And so, it is with great gusto that the industry is coming up with one aangila title after another. After all, a sleek English title adds to the smartness of the movie, you see. Or so they think...SketchThis Vikram-starrer will be one of the first big-budget ‘English-titled’ films to hit the screens post GST. Directed by Vijay Chander, this project was titled long before the verdict came out. Since the time the gangster drama got an official title, there were speculations of the makers going for a title change owing to the potential tax issue. The director had said that the title was chosen keeping in mind the popularity of the word ‘sketch’ among gangsters in North Madras, on whom the movie was made. However, the makers stuck to their decision, and the GST changes only came as a relief to the makers.PartyThe title of this film was announced a few days before GST came into existence. The announcement was a surprise to movie buffs as the makers made it official during the audio launch of Gemini Ganesanum Suruli Rajanum. By the time the surprise regarding the project was revealed on stage, it was confirmed that Kollywood movies need not come up a with Tamil title anymore, though that was not necessarily the reason for them to opt for an English title. Interestingly, one of Venkat Prabhu’s earlier films, Mass, was changed to Massu Engira Masilamani due to the tax-exemption issue.Super DeluxeThiagarajan Kumararaja, who made the critically-acclaimed Aaranya Kaandam, is back to directing a film after more than six years. His film, which features a stellar cast, including the likes of Vijay Sethupathi, Fahadh Faasil, Samantha Akkineni among others, was initially titled as Aneethi Kathaigal. And then, the director surprised one and all by posting a picture of Sethupathi on Twitter a few months ago, along with this English title. And, a few days ago, he had posted a sneak peek of an intriguing sequence, which had Samantha in it, and reiterated that this is indeed the title of his film, through a tweet.BalloonThe horror film, which hit screens in December, was actually announced much earlier. Directed by Sinish and starring Jai, Anjali and Janani Iyer, the spooky film had a smooth release as it opened to the audience much later, post GST came into effect.LensOne of the acclaimed films of last year, the movie, which threw light on the darker side of technology growth, too, was a bilingual film. Earlier, even films that were dubbed from English or Telugu used to have Tamil titles. Lens, surprisingly, retained the title the makers used for its Malayalam version.SoloThis bilingual film was safe with regard to its title, thanks to its post-GST release. However, the film had to suffer due to the theatre strike proposed by Tamil Film Producers Council as a mark of protest against the local body entertainment tax.RUMThe heist film, which released almost a year ago (before GST), didn't run into any big issues. But the makers had once clarified that ‘rum’ is actually a Tamil word with a different meaning, and that the title has no connection with the alcoholic beverage.  \n",

       "3  The recent fire at an outlet in Kalasipalya, which claimed five lives, has caused a lot of concern for safety in restaurants in Bengaluru. But the Bengaluru Bruhat Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) is not going to react in a hasty fashion. The commissioner, Manjunatha Prasad, spoke to us, saying that the BBMP is going to react to this situation in a patient and orderly manner. We quizzed him about some of the rumours that were floating around yesterday and he answered them patiently.“This is a fire incident and we are going to take into account what is recommended by the fire department. We will implement whatever changes or suggestions they give us. There is currently no reaction or release being issued from us,” says Manjunatha.Reacting to rumours that cafés and bars serving hookah will be asked to shut as they pose a fire threat, he says, “No such decision is being taken as of now by us.”As for the matter of notices issued to terrace cafés and lounges across the city earlier this month, he adds, “Those were for a different reason. Most of them were operating on terraces without proper permits. We are issued notices, asking the establishments to get their together and acquire relevant permissions.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        \n",
       "4  There is a conflict in the system of the judiciary, legislature and executive that we are following in the country, which is one of the largest democracies in the world. Why are we taking so many decades to deliver a judgment on a subject that criminalizes one community? This is a constitutional crisis, as there is a law that is directly saying that one section is criminal under it.The historical Delhi High Court ruling of 2009 had actually given us a boost and the confidence to speak about what exactly we are standing for. But then, there was a sense of disappointment with the 2013 Supreme Court judgement, which overturned the HC ruling.What everyone fails to see is that it is not about same sex. The media has also been constantly highlighting ‘gay sex’, which is not the case. Section 377 definitively talks about human sexuality, but it is also about dignity. The law violates my right to privacy and dignity.In fact, when MP Shashi Tharoor introduced the Anti-Discrimination and Equality Bill in 2016 in the Lok Sabha, there was a discussion about homosexuality as well, and the way the members of the house behaved was appalling. Without understanding the legitimacy of the politics of sexuality, they made blind statements that literally undermined one identity, one sexuality and one marginalized community, which is us.Legislators have power and responsibility and they have to behave in that manner. Section 377 is direct violation against us. The Legislature and Executive have been playing an ‘impotent’ role in this matter, which is why we have knocked on the door of the judiciary. Over the years, there have been steps in the right direction and we are thankful to the court for that. In fact, if you look at the rulings of the present Chief Justice, be it in the case of the right to privacy, Aadhar or triple talaq, among others, they have been progressive, so we are hopeful that at least some bits of the section will be deleted, if not completely repealed.

He will be seen playing the villain in Kannan’s film with Atharvaa, which will go on floors this month.Confirming the news, the director says, “I met Upen in Mumbai last week and he was quite taken by the script. He is the ideal fit for the role and he was quite excited with the scope his character offers him. Upen told me that though he had been getting a lot of offers from the south industry, he hadn’t signed on any because they were all quite similar to what he had done before. Right now, we are finalising his looks and other details. I’m excited about the climax action sequence between him and Atharvaa.”The team will begin shooting from January 19 in Chennai. Kannan adds, “Apart from Atharvaa, Megha Akash, Upen, RJ Balaji and Sathish, we’ve also roped in Suhasini ma’am (Maniratnam) for an important role.”</td>\n",

       "4  He made a memorable debut in Kollywood as the antagonist in Shankar’s magnum opus with Vikram, I. Now, after three years, Upen Patel has signed on his next project here. He will be seen playing the villain in Kannan’s film with Atharvaa, which will go on floors this month.Confirming the news, the director says, “I met Upen in Mumbai last week and he was quite taken by the script. He is the ideal fit for the role and he was quite excited with the scope his character offers him. Upen told me that though he had been getting a lot of offers from the south industry, he hadn’t signed on any because they were all quite similar to what he had done before. Right now, we are finalising his looks and other details. I’m excited about the climax action sequence between him and Atharvaa.”The team will begin shooting from January 19 in Chennai. Kannan adds, “Apart from Atharvaa, Megha Akash, Upen, RJ Balaji and Sathish, we’ve also roped in Suhasini ma’am (Maniratnam) for an important role.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       "

       "      <td>Curiosity often makes us question, and that is exactly what pushed Sebastian Thomas, a first year BSc student from St. Joseph’s College to work on his research that won him laurels recently. Sebastian was awarded the Albertian Best Young Scientist Award and the grand prize in the model exhibition at the International Science Conference held in Kochi earlier this month. From a group of 5,000 participants across the world, his work on the Fibonacci sequence — the golden ratio pattern and its application to five different fields — received appreciation from the panel.Speaking to us about his achievement, Sebastian says, “The competition has a lot of place for mathematics. So, when I got to know about it, I started working towards participating in this competition. I discovered unique properties in Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci series has a special position in analytical number theory, basically for its pattern and golden ratio. Hence, I began exploring and thought of its application in five different fields.”The result of Sebastian’s research can be applied in five different fields — in the field of Fourier analysis, in the growth of Hollyhock flowers (which he discovered on the college campus), in genetics where the human genes follow the golden ratio pattern), in the field of ECG and drug monitoring system. He says, “In the field of ECG, to get an analysis done is very expensive. During an ECG, doctors mainly look at the QT interval and tell the condition of your heart. So, I thought of inter-linking my work to find the QT wave interval and I devised a new mathematical formula and the result coincided with the results of an ECG.”Maria Thomas, faculty at St. Joseph’s College and guide for Sebastian’s research work calls him the young Ramanujan, and says, “I feel extremely overwhelmed and proud of his hard work. I am proud to say that I am his teacher. I haven’t seen such potential in anyone in the past 14 years of my career.

       "      <td>The day is finally here when all Nograj fans can see their favourite character on the big screen — for two full laughter-filled hours. The filmmakers are aware of the hype and expectation surrounding Pushkar Films, Lost ‘N’ Found Films and Paramvah Studio’s Humble Politiciann Nograj (HPN), and although this puts a lot of pressure on director Saad Khan, he is equally excited to show his labour of love to audiences. “Being a political satire, we are happy that we got a clean U certificate from the Censor Board, which is because the script does not target any one politician. Nograj is so narcissistic that he wouldn’t want to be compared to anyone else,” says Saad, adding, “So far, only my editor and I have watched the film, and now, I will be watching the audience not the movie.” And why must we all watch this movie this weekend? Saad tells us…The first crazy reason to watch the movie is that you get two hours of Nograj, with as many quirks as possible. Danish Sait as Nograj has done a range of emotions in the film — from A to Z, or Z square, actually. We have not diverted from the character as seen on social media; we have just enhanced everything that Nograj can possibly do. Everyone’s going to be rooting for him after watching the film.There are a host of other characters, each of who have a quirk. They will be very in the face, funny and enjoyable. Not only are they funny, but Nograj’s reaction to them is also hilarious. Since the movie has got a U certificate, you can be sure that there is no sex or slapstick comedy. It’s for family audiences and everyone who loves Nograj.The screenplay and story is unpredictable. I have made a thriller before, so the way I approached HPN was by asking myself how Tarantino would make a movie if he had to do a satire. There is a lot of stuff happening in the background of the film, which warrants a second watch. For e.g., even if Monjunath (Vijay Chendoor’s character) is not in the close-up, you will think, ‘OMG, look at what he is doing in the background’.We are not very preachy in the video and content that we have put on social media so far, and the same has been followed in the film. We have never said openly to vote or take care of the society/city, but we have subtly tried to push that message across; it will be lingering throughout the film.A lot of people love imitating Nograj, and we are hoping that because of the way we have devised the story that after watching HPN, there will be several recall moments. People will go back and repeat the dialogues with friends.</td>\n",

       "0  Curiosity often makes us question, and that is exactly what pushed Sebastian Thomas, a first year BSc student from St. Joseph’s College to work on his research that won him laurels recently. Sebastian was awarded the Albertian Best Young Scientist Award and the grand prize in the model exhibition at the International Science Conference held in Kochi earlier this month. From a group of 5,000 participants across the world, his work on the Fibonacci sequence — the golden ratio pattern and its application to five different fields — received appreciation from the panel.Speaking to us about his achievement, Sebastian says, “The competition has a lot of place for mathematics. So, when I got to know about it, I started working towards participating in this competition. I discovered unique properties in Fibonacci numbers. The Fibonacci series has a special position in analytical number theory, basically for its pattern and golden ratio. Hence, I began exploring and thought of its application in five different fields.”The result of Sebastian’s research can be applied in five different fields — in the field of Fourier analysis, in the growth of Hollyhock flowers (which he discovered on the college campus), in genetics where the human genes follow the golden ratio pattern), in the field of ECG and drug monitoring system. He says, “In the field of ECG, to get an analysis done is very expensive. During an ECG, doctors mainly look at the QT interval and tell the condition of your heart. So, I thought of inter-linking my work to find the QT wave interval and I devised a new mathematical formula and the result coincided with the results of an ECG.”Maria Thomas, faculty at St. Joseph’s College and guide for Sebastian’s research work calls him the young Ramanujan, and says, “I feel extremely overwhelmed and proud of his hard work. I am proud to say that I am his teacher. I haven’t seen such potential in anyone in the past 14 years of my career. His month-long research work is being applied in five different areas is something extraordinary. Sebastian’s research work is more about real-life applications such as in the field of ECG, which is cost-effective.” Sebastian hopes that his findings will help the pharmaceutical industries to come up with cost effective methods in the field of research.

       "3  The day is finally here when all Nograj fans can see their favourite character on the big screen — for two full laughter-filled hours. The filmmakers are aware of the hype and expectation surrounding Pushkar Films, Lost ‘N’ Found Films and Paramvah Studio’s Humble Politiciann Nograj (HPN), and although this puts a lot of pressure on director Saad Khan, he is equally excited to show his labour of love to audiences. “Being a political satire, we are happy that we got a clean U certificate from the Censor Board, which is because the script does not target any one politician. Nograj is so narcissistic that he wouldn’t want to be compared to anyone else,” says Saad, adding, “So far, only my editor and I have watched the film, and now, I will be watching the audience not the movie.” And why must we all watch this movie this weekend? Saad tells us…The first crazy reason to watch the movie is that you get two hours of Nograj, with as many quirks as possible. Danish Sait as Nograj has done a range of emotions in the film — from A to Z, or Z square, actually. We have not diverted from the character as seen on social media; we have just enhanced everything that Nograj can possibly do. Everyone’s going to be rooting for him after watching the film.There are a host of other characters, each of who have a quirk. They will be very in the face, funny and enjoyable. Not only are they funny, but Nograj’s reaction to them is also hilarious. Since the movie has got a U certificate, you can be sure that there is no sex or slapstick comedy. It’s for family audiences and everyone who loves Nograj.The screenplay and story is unpredictable. I have made a thriller before, so the way I approached HPN was by asking myself how Tarantino would make a movie if he had to do a satire. There is a lot of stuff happening in the background of the film, which warrants a second watch. For e.g., even if Monjunath (Vijay Chendoor’s character) is not in the close-up, you will think, ‘OMG, look at what he is doing in the background’.We are not very preachy in the video and content that we have put on social media so far, and the same has been followed in the film. We have never said openly to vote or take care of the society/city, but we have subtly tried to push that message across; it will be lingering throughout the film.A lot of people love imitating Nograj, and we are hoping that because of the way we have devised the story that after watching HPN, there will be several recall moments. People will go back and repeat the dialogues with friends.  \n",

       "      <td>Dressed in identical grey suits, walked in 19 band members of ‘The Casteless Collective’ during their first performance, in the city recently. With thousands gathering to see their performance, the band members were taken aback having received such a warm welcome. The highlight were the lyrics that condemned honour killings in the name of caste pride, quota, discrimination, and manual scavenging. And these videos from the concert have only created ripples on the internet!Arivarasu Kalainesan, an engineering graduate, is one of the lyricists and rapper in the band who authored 10 songs. “I am born and brought up in a slum. I have grown up watching the hardship of discrimination in the name of caste people go through. I used to read and write a lot of poems in school and when I joined college, I got the opportunity to write lyrics for our college band. I gave an audition at Neelam Cultural Centre and I was chosen to work with the band. It’s good to see how through music, people have understood a century old issue.”And this wouldn’t have been possible without director Pa Ranjith, who always wanted to bring gaana on a big stage. Says Ranjith, “For me, art and music is a political tool. I want to highlight social issues through art and music, issues that have been there since centuries but have failed to bring about a change. Gaana is in the blood of every child who is born in the slums of north Madras, the same locality where I come from. They are so skilled yet so far behind in many aspects of life. I want to change that.”Ranjith’s organisation, Neelam Cultural Centre, collaborated with the label ‘Madras Records’ to form ‘The Casteless Collective’, inspired by a Tamil phrase ‘jaathi ilaathu Tamilargal’, used by Tamil anti-caste activist and writer C Iyothee Thass. “This collective goes beyond the barriers of caste. And all of us have one aim — zero discrimination in the name of caste and religion though our tool — music and art,” added Ranjith.That’s when he decided to collaborate with the music composer, Tenma. “We conducted workshops to understand and found a way to bring fusion of gaana, folk, hiphop, rap and rock. It’s more like creating a new genre of music, which has too many elements — powerful stories, percussion instruments like katte and chatti, which are played during funeral processions — and there are rappers and beat boxers. Everyone has an individual personality. I had to conduct them like a gospel choir, more like African gospel because there are too many of everything together,” says Tenma.The artistes are not only from Tamil Nadu, but also Mumbai’s Dharavi’s rap trio, Dopeadelicz. This rap trio has also worked with Ranjith in Kaala.</td>\n",

       "0  Dressed in identical grey suits, walked in 19 band members of ‘The Casteless Collective’ during their first performance, in the city recently. With thousands gathering to see their performance, the band members were taken aback having received such a warm welcome. The highlight were the lyrics that condemned honour killings in the name of caste pride, quota, discrimination, and manual scavenging. And these videos from the concert have only created ripples on the internet!Arivarasu Kalainesan, an engineering graduate, is one of the lyricists and rapper in the band who authored 10 songs. “I am born and brought up in a slum. I have grown up watching the hardship of discrimination in the name of caste people go through. I used to read and write a lot of poems in school and when I joined college, I got the opportunity to write lyrics for our college band. I gave an audition at Neelam Cultural Centre and I was chosen to work with the band. It’s good to see how through music, people have understood a century old issue.”And this wouldn’t have been possible without director Pa Ranjith, who always wanted to bring gaana on a big stage. Says Ranjith, “For me, art and music is a political tool. I want to highlight social issues through art and music, issues that have been there since centuries but have failed to bring about a change. Gaana is in the blood of every child who is born in the slums of north Madras, the same locality where I come from. They are so skilled yet so far behind in many aspects of life. I want to change that.”Ranjith’s organisation, Neelam Cultural Centre, collaborated with the label ‘Madras Records’ to form ‘The Casteless Collective’, inspired by a Tamil phrase ‘jaathi ilaathu Tamilargal’, used by Tamil anti-caste activist and writer C Iyothee Thass. “This collective goes beyond the barriers of caste. And all of us have one aim — zero discrimination in the name of caste and religion though our tool — music and art,” added Ranjith.That’s when he decided to collaborate with the music composer, Tenma. “We conducted workshops to understand and found a way to bring fusion of gaana, folk, hiphop, rap and rock. It’s more like creating a new genre of music, which has too many elements — powerful stories, percussion instruments like katte and chatti, which are played during funeral processions — and there are rappers and beat boxers. Everyone has an individual personality. I had to conduct them like a gospel choir, more like African gospel because there are too many of everything together,” says Tenma.The artistes are not only from Tamil Nadu, but also Mumbai’s Dharavi’s rap trio, Dopeadelicz. This rap trio has also worked with Ranjith in Kaala.  \n",

Producer Chandrashekar R Padmashali and director Madhusudhan Gowda first worked together in TV serials over 20 years ago, and then went on to form one of the most successful ad agencies in Karnataka.“Chandrashekar takes care of the finance and administrative side and I, the creative side. We tasted success through our ad agency, but somewhere, we felt that we had lost our way, because we were passionate about making tele-serials. We wanted to get back on track, and this time, we decided to do that through films,” says Madhusudhan, adding that Chandrashekar is a passionate producer, who is clear about the story, artistes and locations. He, in fact, went above and beyond his role as producer and did all he could to ensure that they make a classy film, says Madhusudhan.Telling us about his debut in Sandalwood with this film, Chandrashekar says, “The script of 3 Gante 30 Dina 30 Second explores love in different angles. Today, everyone interprets love in their own way, and somewhere, it seems like the youth has lost its way. The film explores this and the approach to emotions as well; for e.g., would you want to first get settled in life and then look for love, or look for love and then get settled? It’s a family entertainer and everyone has done a good job. Madhusudhan’s work is such that after watching the film, you can’t tell that it is his first film as director.”</td>\n",

       "      <td>Human nature is such that when we get something new, we tend to ignore the old. This is the premise that the team of the upcoming Kannada film, Gowdru Cycle, is looking at exploring. Directed by newbie Prashanth, the film stars Shashikanth and Bimbashri (of Rama Rama Re fame) in the lead.“As the title suggests, the theme surrounds a bicycle, which actually is a central character in the tale. The plot works on the premise that once something becomes old and is deemed useless, you should not just throw it away. For instance, when you buy a new pair of shoes, you tend to ignore your older pairs, until such time that you lose the new one and are forced to find the old one again. Similarly, just because your parents have become old, you should not neglect them.Generally, what we see in society is that our parents take care of all our needs, then one fine day the child (son) gets married and once the wife is in the picture, he begins to ignore his parents, focusing on his ‘own’ family. The universal truth is that whatever the child does, parents will always love them and most people realize this only when they themselves age, have children and are in the same situation as their parents were years before. Instead of repenting then, our film tells audiences to respect their parents now. Gowdru Cycle is, therefore, a complete family entertainer, with a pertinent message,” says the filmmaker.</td>\n",

Titled Panchatantra, the film will see her pair with Vihaan Gowda. “The movie has two heroines (Akshara Gowda is the other), but I have the main role and will essay both a traditional and glamorous girl,” adds the actress, who recently wrapped up shooting for MLA with Pratham.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "4  Human nature is such that when we get something new, we tend to ignore the old. This is the premise that the team of the upcoming Kannada film, Gowdru Cycle, is looking at exploring. Directed by newbie Prashanth, the film stars Shashikanth and Bimbashri (of Rama Rama Re fame) in the lead.“As the title suggests, the theme surrounds a bicycle, which actually is a central character in the tale. The plot works on the premise that once something becomes old and is deemed useless, you should not just throw it away. For instance, when you buy a new pair of shoes, you tend to ignore your older pairs, until such time that you lose the new one and are forced to find the old one again. Similarly, just because your parents have become old, you should not neglect them.Generally, what we see in society is that our parents take care of all our needs, then one fine day the child (son) gets married and once the wife is in the picture, he begins to ignore his parents, focusing on his ‘own’ family. The universal truth is that whatever the child does, parents will always love them and most people realize this only when they themselves age, have children and are in the same situation as their parents were years before. Instead of repenting then, our film tells audiences to respect their parents now. Gowdru Cycle is, therefore, a complete family entertainer, with a pertinent message,” says the filmmaker.

KWA has recently noticed dip in water level at Vamanapuram River, which might affect water supply to Attingal, Varkala regions by summer.The minister has directed KWA officials to construct temporary check dams near 11 KWA schemes in Vamanapuram River. However, this measure will be effective only if the area receives enough summer showers .The fund for construction of temporary check dams will be met from drought relief fund.KWA officials have also asked the irrigation department to check whether the height of check dam at Poovanpara could be raised from 2.7 metres to 3.4 metres so as to save more water.“Currently, the purpose of the check dam is to prevent saline intrusion and so the height is limited to 2.7 metres. We have learned that in the original design it was 3.4 metres. If it is raised, more water could be saved,” said an official. tnn</td>\n",

Though she became a contestant through wild card entry, she made it through each daunting task with the same enthusiasm and caliber as the rest of the ladies, who were battling it out from day one of the show. Perhaps it was her steadfast attitude that brought her straight to the finale and even fetched her the winner’s trophy.Paris Laxmi tells us what kept her going throughout the show and expresses her happiness, which she says knows no bounds.How do you feel after winning?It feels great that I won! I had never been interested in reality shows earlier, however when I was approached for this show, the thought of being able to do daredevil acts excited me. The fact that Dare the Fear was an all-women show was also appealing.Being part of the show was a completely new experience for me. I felt that this was one platform where girls get to show the world that they are as tough as men.Initially, I never wanted to think about losing the show, and also did not want to plague my mind with unwarranted thoughts. While many might have fear of different things, I was constantly in the fear of losing, and always strove to be at my best in the race.As we were nearing the final, we had all the best contestants competing with each other for the trophy, and everyone, who made it to the last stage, were well-deserving to be the winner. At that time, no one really knew what would happen, and I was ready to accept whatever the result was going to be. I wasn’t thinking about winning anymore.

The most challenging was the one upon a bridge, where we had to go down a ladder, as it called for a lot of arm strength.When you entered the show as a wild card contestant, were you nervous?I was not nervous at all, but I was curious how the rest of the contestants would react or what kind of a reception I will get from them, as I was making an entry halfway. I think a few of them were upset too, that I was not there from day one. Regardless, I think all of us had the same enthusiasm and physical capacity to complete each task and only that mattered ultimately.Then again, the pressure on me was tremendous. Even before I appeared for the first task, people around me started saying that everyone has high expectations about my performance and I have to meet them.What was your family’s reaction?When the makers of the show contacted me, my husband was a bit concerned about my safety. When I told him that the contestants will be backed by a professional team, he was relieved and gave me a thumbs up. The next ‘task’ was convincing my parents. As I knew they will be tensed about it, I had to tell my mother that it was quite unlike the adventure reality shows we have in France, and the tasks in this are a lot simpler.My father did not know anything about it initially, and when he later saw the videos of the stunts, he realised how tough they were. He started panicking so much that at one point of time, he told my mother ‘Ask her to stop it’ (laughs). However, when I won the show, everyone including my parents and my brother were really happy. My friends in France were equally excited about it. My family really believed in me throughout the show.</td>\n",

       "      <td>For actor-dancer Paris Laxmi, contesting in the adventure reality show Dare the Fear on Asianet was literally a leap of faith.Though she became a contestant through wild card entry, she made it through each daunting tasks with the same enthusiasm and caliber as the rest of the ladies, who were battling it out from day one of the show. Perhaps it was her steadfast attitude that brought her straight to the finale and even fetched her the winner’s trophy.Paris Laxmi tells us what kept her going throughout the show and expresses her happiness, which she says knows no bounds.How do you feel after winning?It feels great that I won! I had never been interested in reality shows earlier, however when I was approached for this show, the thought of being able to do daredevil acts excited me. The fact that Dare the Fear was an all-women show was also appealing.Being part of the show was a completely new experience for me. I felt that this was one platform where girls get to show the world that they are as tough as men.Initially, I never wanted to think about losing the show, and also did not want to plague my mind with unwarranted thoughts.

       "0  Thiruvananthapuram: A meeting convened by water resources minister Mathew T Thomas to review drought mitigation works decided to construct temporary check dams near all major schemes of Kerala water authority at the Vamanapuram River. KWA has recently noticed dip in water level at Vamanapuram River, which might affect water supply to Attingal, Varkala regions by summer.The minister has directed KWA officials to construct temporary check dams near 11 KWA schemes in Vamanapuram River. However, this measure will be effective only if the area receives enough summer showers .The fund for construction of temporary check dams will be met from drought relief fund.KWA officials have also asked the irrigation department to check whether the height of check dam at Poovanpara could be raised from 2.7 metres to 3.4 metres so as to save more water.“Currently, the purpose of the check dam is to prevent saline intrusion and so the height is limited to 2.7 metres. We have learned that in the original design it was 3.4 metres. If it is raised, more water could be saved,” said an official. tnn                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "1  For actor-dancer Paris Laxmi, contesting in the adventure reality show Dare the Fear on Asianet was literally a leap of faith. Though she became a contestant through wild card entry, she made it through each daunting task with the same enthusiasm and caliber as the rest of the ladies, who were battling it out from day one of the show. Perhaps it was her steadfast attitude that brought her straight to the finale and even fetched her the winner’s trophy.Paris Laxmi tells us what kept her going throughout the show and expresses her happiness, which she says knows no bounds.How do you feel after winning?It feels great that I won! I had never been interested in reality shows earlier, however when I was approached for this show, the thought of being able to do daredevil acts excited me. The fact that Dare the Fear was an all-women show was also appealing.Being part of the show was a completely new experience for me. I felt that this was one platform where girls get to show the world that they are as tough as men.Initially, I never wanted to think about losing the show, and also did not want to plague my mind with unwarranted thoughts. While many might have fear of different things, I was constantly in the fear of losing, and always strove to be at my best in the race.As we were nearing the final, we had all the best contestants competing with each other for the trophy, and everyone, who made it to the last stage, were well-deserving to be the winner. At that time, no one really knew what would happen, and I was ready to accept whatever the result was going to be. I wasn’t thinking about winning anymore. It was when the makers calculated all the scores we had attained till then that I was announced the winner.How did it help you on a personal level?As I could perform a lot of adventurous tasks that required umpteen courage, I now have the knack to handle more of such similar stunts. I think it will help me as an actor as well, as we are often asked to do stunts as part of essaying characters in a film. I am now excited to try out these skills in movies too.Dare the Fear also had many other takeaways for me. I was never afraid of animals, and the only thing I was scared of was heights. Despite that, something inside me instilled the courage as I had no other choice but face heights for the tasks. I took everything in its stride in the show. In life, we tend to focus more on our fears rather than our skills. Post the show, whenever I am in tough situations, I tell myself, ‘If you were in the game, you would have done it anyway’.The most memorable moment.During the first few days, we were completely clueless about what the next day will have in store for us. I was always looking forward to the next task. I enjoyed doing the fire task, while rolling on a barrel, though it was physically demanding. The most challenging was the one upon a bridge, where we had to go down a ladder, as it called for a lot of arm strength.When you entered the show as a wild card contestant, were you nervous?I was not nervous at all, but I was curious how the rest of the contestants would react or what kind of a reception I will get from them, as I was making an entry halfway. I think a few of them were upset too, that I was not there from day one. Regardless, I think all of us had the same enthusiasm and physical capacity to complete each task and only that mattered ultimately.Then again, the pressure on me was tremendous. Even before I appeared for the first task, people around me started saying that everyone has high expectations about my performance and I have to meet them.What was your family’s reaction?When the makers of the show contacted me, my husband was a bit concerned about my safety. When I told him that the contestants will be backed by a professional team, he was relieved and gave me a thumbs up. The next ‘task’ was convincing my parents. As I knew they will be tensed about it, I had to tell my mother that it was quite unlike the adventure reality shows we have in France, and the tasks in this are a lot simpler.My father did not know anything about it initially, and when he later saw the videos of the stunts, he realised how tough they were.

       "3  For actor-dancer Paris Laxmi, contesting in the adventure reality show Dare the Fear on Asianet was literally a leap of faith.Though she became a contestant through wild card entry, she made it through each daunting tasks with the same enthusiasm and caliber as the rest of the ladies, who were battling it out from day one of the show. Perhaps it was her steadfast attitude that brought her straight to the finale and even fetched her the winner’s trophy.Paris Laxmi tells us what kept her going throughout the show and expresses her happiness, which she says knows no bounds.How do you feel after winning?It feels great that I won! I had never been interested in reality shows earlier, however when I was approached for this show, the thought of being able to do daredevil acts excited me. The fact that Dare the Fear was an all-women show was also appealing.Being part of the show was a completely new experience for me. I felt that this was one platform where girls get to show the world that they are as tough as men.Initially, I never wanted to think about losing the show, and also did not want to plague my mind with unwarranted thoughts. While many might have fear of different things, I was constantly in the fear of losing, and always strove to be at my best in the race.As we were nearing the final, we had all the best contestants competing with each other for the trophy, and everyone, who made it to the last stage, were well-deserving to be the winner. At that time, no one really knew what would happen, and I was ready to accept whatever the result was going to be. I wasn’t thinking about winning anymore. It was when the makers calculated all the scores we had attained till then that I was announced the winner.How did it help you on a personal level?As I could perform a lot of adventurous tasks that required umpteen courage, I now have the knack to handle more of such similar stunts. I think it will help me as an actor as well, as we are often asked to do stunts as part of essaying characters in a film. I am now excited to try out these skills in movies too.Dare the Fear also made me strong on a few other counts. I was never afraid of animals, and the only thing I was scared of was heights. Despite that, something inside me instilled the courage as I had no other choice but face heights for the tasks. I took everything in its stride in the show. In life, we tend to focus more on our fears rather than our skills. Post the show, whenever I am in tough situations, I tell myself, ‘If you were in the game, you would have done it anyway’.The moments etched to your memoryDuring the first few days, we were completely clueless about what the next day will have in store for us. I was always looking forward to the next task. I enjoyed doing the fire task, while rolling on a barrel, though it was physically demanding. The most challenging one of all was the one upon a bridge, where we had to go down a ladder, as it called for a lot of arm strength.When you entered the show as a wild card contestant, were you nervous?I was not nervous at all, but I was curious how the rest of the contestants would react or what kind of a reception I will get from them, as I was making an entry halfway. I think a few of them were upset too, that I was not there from day one. Regardless, I think all of us had the same enthusiasm and physical capacity to complete each task and only that mattered ultimately.Then again, the pressure on me was tremendous. Even before I appeared for the first task, people around me started saying that everyone has high expectations about my performance and I have to meet them.What was your family’s reaction?When the makers of the show contacted me, my husband was a bit concerned about my safety. When I told him that the contestants will be backed by a professional team, he was relieved and gave me a thumbs up. The next ‘task’ was convincing my parents. As I knew they will be tensed about it, I had to tell my mother that it was quite unlike the adventure reality shows we have in France, and the tasks in this are a lot simpler.My father did not know anything about it initially, and when he later saw the videos of the stunts, he realized how tough they were. He started panicking so much that at one point of time, he told my mother ‘Ask her to stop it’ (laughs). However, when I won the show, everyone including my parents and my brother were really happy. My friends in France were equally excited about it. My family really believed in me throughout the show.  \n",

She is also part of Pranav Mohanlal’s Aadi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "      <td>The group of specially abled children sang traditional harvest folk songs of their land, danced, and played in the soil as they ploughed, tilled and planted rice saplings in the paddy field. But the greenery and rich soil are not in Kerala, or India for that matter, but in the city of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates! For the 67 children from Kerala, Goa, North India and the Middle East, it was a novel experience as even the sight of a paddy field amidst the sands of Sharjah was new to them, while their parents rejoiced on seeing them doing something productive..The children planted the saplings in the 27 cents of land situated next to the rented home of agriculturalist Sudheesh Guruvayoor, and followed his directions. “I am overwhelmed seeing the enthusiasm of the kids. I gave them two weeks’ training, both theory and practice. We let them play on the field and asked the parents not to worry about them getting muddy. They are getting to know nature,” he says.Sudheesh, who promotes organic farming in UAE, came up with the idea after watching a programme about differently abled kids on television. “As part of enlightening the next generation on the need for agriculture, I had taken students of three schools to the open space beside my house to plant rice saplings, four months back. It was really fruitful and we got five ‘paras’ (around 40 kg) of paddy. We have processed it at home,” he says.It wasn’t an easy process making the dry soil of Sharjah fertile, Sudheesh reveals. “It was a long and strenuous process. I tilled the land, watered it for months, added dry cow dung and dry goat pellets and did vermicomposting, making the soil suitable for cultivation. Once the land became fertile, things were easy,” Sudheesh explains.This time, he decided to take differently abled children to his farm. “When I spoke to Dr P Mary Anitha who works closely with the specially abled kids, she said that working in the fields can help them undergo therapies such as mud therapy, greenery therapy, water therapy and physiotherapy. I decided to go ahead,” he says. The plantation festival began on the morning of January 13, at 10 am, and went on till 1 pm, followed by a few cultural programmes. The harvesting will be done during the time of Vishu. “There were singers, dancers besides kids with other talents. I learnt a new lesson by joining them to plant saplings. Nothing is impossible for them, and they don’t our sympathy. They should be treated like everybody else,” he says.Sudheesh, an electrical engineer from Guruvayoor, was working at the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority before he quit his job in 2002, after falling in love with farming.</td>\n",

       "      <td>American artist Man Ray had once said, “To create is divine, to reproduce is human.” As January marks International Creativity Month, we ask students if colleges are indeed platforms for creativity to bloom, and the ways in which they pursue their artistic endeavoursOpportunities galore to explore one’s creative skills: Aroma Thompson David, University of KeralaWhenever there are celebrations at college or in class, I use my skills to make it look more artistic, and my friends encourage me a lot. I rely on the Internet at times to explore creative ideas and ensure to improve the concept in my own way. I derive inspiration from a few images on newspaper, and I try to recreate them through certain structures and forms. I like to paint occasionally, and when I come up with something creative, I have had friends asking me if a certain motif will offend someone or a group. In that way, I think many of us have second thoughts while showcasing their skills and that affects one’s creative freedom to certain extent.That said, technological advancements are rapidly transforming the perspectives of the ordinary man, and the opportunities to explore one’s creative skills have become more now than ever before. Online portals have helped people like me access more creative and innovative content from different parts of the world. We all have multiple perspectives of ideas to create a piece of art but often are unable to put that into action. That’s where such online mediums come to the rescue. Technological developments are also helping us to express and share our innovations, ideas and creativities on a global platform.More space should be provided for students to showcase their talents: Zinin Ashraf KV from CUSATAgainst the backdrop of intolerance prevailing in the society, I think college students still have the freedom to express through the tool of art. There are times when their talent reach the zenith of artistic brilliance. During tech fests, we have various opportunities to bring forth our creative world. However, I feel more space should be provided for the same.Apart from that, instead of mindlessly scrolling social media for hours, we can turn to our phones for specific tools. For instance, we can use the camera feature to take photos of our favourite things, and hence there can be different favourite each day. Compile them using different apps. You can also find out the basic steps to become a vlogger. Apps are beneficial to a great extent, as they give ratings for achieving each level, which in turn helped me to work out more in the fitness club. It would be great fun to complete a workout and share the joy with my friends. I have tried my hands at furniture design as well through the help of such apps.Social media has made me confident to do what I am good at: Akhil S Prasad from National College of Arts and Science, ThiruvananthapuramWhether students have the scope of nurturing their creativity is indeed a big question to ask in today’s age. I think youngsters with great potential are not given the needed boost in college like how others colleges do, as other than Union Day or Fresher’s Day, we only get a few stages to exhibit our talents. Many managements fail to uplift a student, contribute to his development or nourish his individual talents.However, with the advent of social media, students like me, who have an inclination towards art have started getting the required exposure for their skills; t he likes and shares that we garner through the medium strengthen our morale and instil confidence in us. That is precisely the reason which keeps me going, while doing Dubsmash videos.Creating something on your own is an overwhelming experience: Duedy Thomas from Sacred Heart CollegeThe art of creating something, without having anyone judge him or her is something important. By pooling in your imaginations, you can get umpteen new ideas from others, as the way I see the world will be quite different from what others see. Hence, the blend of creativities can be path-breaking as well.Social media has been a boon in this regard, and I analyse various ways of creating something, following which I try to give a personal touch to it. Recently, I got inspired to decorate plastic bottles with colourful and starry lights. My college has different avenues such as Creativity Club, Arts Club etc for students, who are well versed in dance, arts and designing. Events such as the sale in the college give us the chance to make the best use of our thoughts and talents to match the theme of the programme.</td>\n",

       "      <td>When they came together for Minnale in 2001, they created magic on screen. And now, 17 years later, we hear that Gautham Menon and Madhavan are all set to team up for a trilingual. The film, which will be made in Tamil, Hindi and English, is expected to go on floors once the two of them are free of their present commitments.A source in the know tells us, “Gautham Menon debuted in the industry with Minnale, and it turned out to be one of the biggest hits in both Gautham and Madhavan’s careers. They even worked in its Hindi remake, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein. A few years ago, Gautham had plans of making a multi-lingual film with four stars from the four south Indian film industries. Madhavan could be a part of this film. Things are, however, in the nascent stage, and nothing has been formally finalised.”While Gautham is currently working on Dhruva Natchathiram with Vikram, Madhavan has Sarkunam’s untitled film among other projects in Kollywood.</td>\n",

       "      <td>A woman’s clothing has always been subjected to scrutiny, especially at times when she has been violated or sexually harassed, when often it is her outfit that is blamed. In a bid to offer collective healing to victims who’ve experienced sexual harassment or assault, Blank Noise, a community, is organizing #INeverAskForIt on January 21 in Cubbon Park. One of the highlights of the event will be victims bringing outfits that they were wearing at the time they were sexually harassed.Speaking about the event, Jasmeen Patheja, founder, Blank Noise, says that the garments represent the individual’s voice. “All the action heroes who have built the ‘I Never Ask For It’ project have said, ‘I feel safe when we are heard. I feel safe when I am not judged. I feel safe when I don’t have to justify, defend or explain myself over and over and over again’,” says Jasmeen, adding that by having such events, they aim to create insights and a path for people looking at collective healing. “We are motivated by the conversations it would take to build this together — by the personal and collective healing it could offer. We are also motivated by the idea that building #INeverAskForIt calls each of us to step into our potential towards being another person’s safe space,” says Jasmeen, adding, “This is why we are creating circles of listening or speaking only if ready.”With campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp — that speak about sexual harassment across the world — how does #INeverAskForIt help people, we ask? “#MeToo has led to a new collective awakening — that all women have, at some point, experienced sexual assault or abuse. Each person who said #MeToo recalled a time in their life when they felt violated. The #INeverAskForIt project is a long-term commitment, built through public and community engagement, participation and collective ownership,” says Jasmeen, adding that in the coming months there will be more such events across the country.“We envision 10,000 garments facing sites of public significance by 2022. There will be more street interventions and projects built across sites, places and communities in the coming year,” Jasmeen sums up.</td>\n",

       "0  The group of specially abled children sang traditional harvest folk songs of their land, danced, and played in the soil as they ploughed, tilled and planted rice saplings in the paddy field. But the greenery and rich soil are not in Kerala, or India for that matter, but in the city of Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates! For the 67 children from Kerala, Goa, North India and the Middle East, it was a novel experience as even the sight of a paddy field amidst the sands of Sharjah was new to them, while their parents rejoiced on seeing them doing something productive..The children planted the saplings in the 27 cents of land situated next to the rented home of agriculturalist Sudheesh Guruvayoor, and followed his directions. “I am overwhelmed seeing the enthusiasm of the kids. I gave them two weeks’ training, both theory and practice. We let them play on the field and asked the parents not to worry about them getting muddy. They are getting to know nature,” he says.Sudheesh, who promotes organic farming in UAE, came up with the idea after watching a programme about differently abled kids on television. “As part of enlightening the next generation on the need for agriculture, I had taken students of three schools to the open space beside my house to plant rice saplings, four months back. It was really fruitful and we got five ‘paras’ (around 40 kg) of paddy. We have processed it at home,” he says.It wasn’t an easy process making the dry soil of Sharjah fertile, Sudheesh reveals. “It was a long and strenuous process. I tilled the land, watered it for months, added dry cow dung and dry goat pellets and did vermicomposting, making the soil suitable for cultivation. Once the land became fertile, things were easy,” Sudheesh explains.This time, he decided to take differently abled children to his farm. “When I spoke to Dr P Mary Anitha who works closely with the specially abled kids, she said that working in the fields can help them undergo therapies such as mud therapy, greenery therapy, water therapy and physiotherapy. I decided to go ahead,” he says. The plantation festival began on the morning of January 13, at 10 am, and went on till 1 pm, followed by a few cultural programmes. The harvesting will be done during the time of Vishu. “There were singers, dancers besides kids with other talents. I learnt a new lesson by joining them to plant saplings. Nothing is impossible for them, and they don’t our sympathy. They should be treated like everybody else,” he says.Sudheesh, an electrical engineer from Guruvayoor, was working at the Sharjah Electricity and Water Authority before he quit his job in 2002, after falling in love with farming.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "1  American artist Man Ray had once said, “To create is divine, to reproduce is human.” As January marks International Creativity Month, we ask students if colleges are indeed platforms for creativity to bloom, and the ways in which they pursue their artistic endeavoursOpportunities galore to explore one’s creative skills: Aroma Thompson David, University of KeralaWhenever there are celebrations at college or in class, I use my skills to make it look more artistic, and my friends encourage me a lot. I rely on the Internet at times to explore creative ideas and ensure to improve the concept in my own way. I derive inspiration from a few images on newspaper, and I try to recreate them through certain structures and forms. I like to paint occasionally, and when I come up with something creative, I have had friends asking me if a certain motif will offend someone or a group. In that way, I think many of us have second thoughts while showcasing their skills and that affects one’s creative freedom to certain extent.That said, technological advancements are rapidly transforming the perspectives of the ordinary man, and the opportunities to explore one’s creative skills have become more now than ever before. Online portals have helped people like me access more creative and innovative content from different parts of the world. We all have multiple perspectives of ideas to create a piece of art but often are unable to put that into action. That’s where such online mediums come to the rescue. Technological developments are also helping us to express and share our innovations, ideas and creativities on a global platform.More space should be provided for students to showcase their talents: Zinin Ashraf KV from CUSATAgainst the backdrop of intolerance prevailing in the society, I think college students still have the freedom to express through the tool of art. There are times when their talent reach the zenith of artistic brilliance. During tech fests, we have various opportunities to bring forth our creative world. However, I feel more space should be provided for the same.Apart from that, instead of mindlessly scrolling social media for hours, we can turn to our phones for specific tools. For instance, we can use the camera feature to take photos of our favourite things, and hence there can be different favourite each day. Compile them using different apps. You can also find out the basic steps to become a vlogger. Apps are beneficial to a great extent, as they give ratings for achieving each level, which in turn helped me to work out more in the fitness club. It would be great fun to complete a workout and share the joy with my friends. I have tried my hands at furniture design as well through the help of such apps.Social media has made me confident to do what I am good at: Akhil S Prasad from National College of Arts and Science, ThiruvananthapuramWhether students have the scope of nurturing their creativity is indeed a big question to ask in today’s age. I think youngsters with great potential are not given the needed boost in college like how others colleges do, as other than Union Day or Fresher’s Day, we only get a few stages to exhibit our talents. Many managements fail to uplift a student, contribute to his development or nourish his individual talents.However, with the advent of social media, students like me, who have an inclination towards art have started getting the required exposure for their skills; t he likes and shares that we garner through the medium strengthen our morale and instil confidence in us. That is precisely the reason which keeps me going, while doing Dubsmash videos.Creating something on your own is an overwhelming experience: Duedy Thomas from Sacred Heart CollegeThe art of creating something, without having anyone judge him or her is something important. By pooling in your imaginations, you can get umpteen new ideas from others, as the way I see the world will be quite different from what others see. Hence, the blend of creativities can be path-breaking as well.Social media has been a boon in this regard, and I analyse various ways of creating something, following which I try to give a personal touch to it. Recently, I got inspired to decorate plastic bottles with colourful and starry lights. My college has different avenues such as Creativity Club, Arts Club etc for students, who are well versed in dance, arts and designing. Events such as the sale in the college give us the chance to make the best use of our thoughts and talents to match the theme of the programme.  \n",
       "2  When they came together for Minnale in 2001, they created magic on screen. And now, 17 years later, we hear that Gautham Menon and Madhavan are all set to team up for a trilingual. The film, which will be made in Tamil, Hindi and English, is expected to go on floors once the two of them are free of their present commitments.A source in the know tells us, “Gautham Menon debuted in the industry with Minnale, and it turned out to be one of the biggest hits in both Gautham and Madhavan’s careers. They even worked in its Hindi remake, Rehnaa Hai Terre Dil Mein. A few years ago, Gautham had plans of making a multi-lingual film with four stars from the four south Indian film industries. Madhavan could be a part of this film. Things are, however, in the nascent stage, and nothing has been formally finalised.”While Gautham is currently working on Dhruva Natchathiram with Vikram, Madhavan has Sarkunam’s untitled film among other projects in Kollywood.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "4  A woman’s clothing has always been subjected to scrutiny, especially at times when she has been violated or sexually harassed, when often it is her outfit that is blamed. In a bid to offer collective healing to victims who’ve experienced sexual harassment or assault, Blank Noise, a community, is organizing #INeverAskForIt on January 21 in Cubbon Park. One of the highlights of the event will be victims bringing outfits that they were wearing at the time they were sexually harassed.Speaking about the event, Jasmeen Patheja, founder, Blank Noise, says that the garments represent the individual’s voice. “All the action heroes who have built the ‘I Never Ask For It’ project have said, ‘I feel safe when we are heard. I feel safe when I am not judged. I feel safe when I don’t have to justify, defend or explain myself over and over and over again’,” says Jasmeen, adding that by having such events, they aim to create insights and a path for people looking at collective healing. “We are motivated by the conversations it would take to build this together — by the personal and collective healing it could offer. We are also motivated by the idea that building #INeverAskForIt calls each of us to step into our potential towards being another person’s safe space,” says Jasmeen, adding, “This is why we are creating circles of listening or speaking only if ready.”With campaigns like #MeToo and #TimesUp — that speak about sexual harassment across the world — how does #INeverAskForIt help people, we ask? “#MeToo has led to a new collective awakening — that all women have, at some point, experienced sexual assault or abuse. Each person who said #MeToo recalled a time in their life when they felt violated. The #INeverAskForIt project is a long-term commitment, built through public and community engagement, participation and collective ownership,” says Jasmeen, adding that in the coming months there will be more such events across the country.“We envision 10,000 garments facing sites of public significance by 2022. There will be more street interventions and projects built across sites, places and communities in the coming year,” Jasmeen sums up.

She plays a baking enthusiast who also records and uploads her recipes on her own blog, and she also plays an architect. While there aren’t much differences in her physical appearances in the two roles, Trisha had to work hard on the different body language required for them.

The youngster, who has previously hosted shows like Hello Doctor and done movie reviews for channels, is now busy with Wide Angle — Cinema A to Z.Mohana says, “I wanted to do webseries and short films, and shows like these give me the right platform. I enjoy doing Wide Angle because it’s all about cinema. I keep updating myself with the latest in the industry. Even before I started doing these shows, I used to watch a lot of films, irrespective of the language.”The show, which airs on Vendhar, has different segments — while Black Ticket deals with Kollywood, 360 is all about world cinema and interesting incidents from there. In Flashback, Mohana gives trivia from films that have stood the test of time and achieved cult status. In Star Book, she talks about social media pages of stars. “I like the Black Ticket segment because it updates audience about namma Tamil films. Everyone can relate to this,” she adds.Ask her how she preps for the show, and Mohana says, “If it’s just news that people want, they can find out by browsing the net. But, if you want the audience to watch your show, it’s important to present it well. We need to make the show interesting enough for them to switch on the TV.”Presently, she is part of Kaalkattu, a webseries. “I play the female lead’s friend. She has revolutionary ideas and orthodox people will love to hate her,” she signs off with a smile.</td>\n",

       "2  It’s been widely speculated that Trisha will play a dual role in her upcoming film, Madhesh’s horror action thriller Mohini. While one role is that of a baker, we have now learnt from reliable sources that the other is that of an architect.The source tells us, “Yes, Trisha plays a double role in the film, and both are distinctly different from each other. She plays a baking enthusiast who also records and uploads her recipes on her own blog, and she also plays an architect. While there aren’t much differences in her physical appearances in the two roles, Trisha had to work hard on the different body language required for them. Her manner of speaking, too, will be distinct in each of her two roles.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      \n",

       "4  It has always been her dream to appear on the screen, and Mohana is glad that she has been able to realise it with a bunch of shows she has done for the small screen. The youngster, who has previously hosted shows like Hello Doctor and done movie reviews for channels, is now busy with Wide Angle — Cinema A to Z.Mohana says, “I wanted to do webseries and short films, and shows like these give me the right platform. I enjoy doing Wide Angle because it’s all about cinema. I keep updating myself with the latest in the industry. Even before I started doing these shows, I used to watch a lot of films, irrespective of the language.”The show, which airs on Vendhar, has different segments — while Black Ticket deals with Kollywood, 360 is all about world cinema and interesting incidents from there. In Flashback, Mohana gives trivia from films that have stood the test of time and achieved cult status. In Star Book, she talks about social media pages of stars. “I like the Black Ticket segment because it updates audience about namma Tamil films. Everyone can relate to this,” she adds.Ask her how she preps for the show, and Mohana says, “If it’s just news that people want, they can find out by browsing the net. But, if you want the audience to watch your show, it’s important to present it well. We need to make the show interesting enough for them to switch on the TV.”Presently, she is part of Kaalkattu, a webseries. “I play the female lead’s friend. She has revolutionary ideas and orthodox people will love to hate her,” she signs off with a smile.  "

       "      <td>What gives someone the right to comment on what happens behind a closed bedroom door?Why curb people’s natural sexual orientations with laws like IPC section 377? The reason is nothing but unequal rights and as long as it remains so, sexual preferences will remain a subject that’s constantly talked about, says Delhi-based choreographer Mandeep Raikhy. And he has not just been talking about it, but protesting against it through his creative medium, dance.Mandeep’s creation titled Queen-size, a travelling contemporary dance performance that was staged across 21 cities for 52 performances last year, will be organised in Kochi in association with Queerala this weekend. The show involves two men, dancer Lalit Khatana and Mandeep himself, who engage with each other over a charpoy and the two-hour 30 minutes show plays out in three loops of 45 minutes each. Apparently, it even invites the audience to move around during the play, watch it from different positions or even enter and leave any time they like!“The performance has a non-linear narrative and we use our bodies to convey the physical and emotional connection between two male bodies. There is no story-line and each of the loops has similarities, but also differences in the way we improvise, set the background and more. We dance to a sound score that resonates the pulse of the body,” explains Mandeep, who has reasons to not work in a traditional format. “I have worked with a few such productions and they have their limitations. I want to take it to the maximum audience possible, and for that, I guess such a format is what suits the best,” he explains. Queen-size, as it can be guessed, refers to the size of the bed. “The performance poses questions around spectatorship, privacy and dissent, deliberately making this encounter visible,” says Mandeep, who has a BA (Hons) in dance theatre from London and has worked with Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company for several years. Some of his other famed works include Geometry and Antenne.A gay man himself, he felt inspired to come up with Queen-size after reading a write-up by the late gay activist Nishit Saran in 2000, which was titled Why My Bedroom Habits Are Your Business. “It might have been written about 18 years ago, but is still relevant and I feel deeply connected with the issues and causes he wrote about. As for our performance, the reactions we get from different people range from transformation to anger. There are also those who came up to us saying they felt baffled, uncomfortable and more,” openly admits the artiste, who has been to Kerala as part of the International Theatre Fest in 2016.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Imagine these real life scenarios:A woman who is a graduate and employed as an HR coordinator says: A classmate of mine was found dead within a week of marriage. The husband had apparently hit her in a fit of rage. But he didn’t really mean to kill her, and she must have said something to provoke him, knowing her.A lady doctor tells a divorcee friend who walked out of a marriage following extreme violence: “To stay or not to stay in a marriage is a choice. If I were in your place, I might have stayed.”An MA student from a reputed university in the country says during a classroom discussion about women in cinema: “I don’t think the Malayalam film where Mohanlal talks about wanting a wife to kick when he gets home is sexist. After all, it would be every woman’s fantasy to be kicked by her man, at least once.”Considering that all these Malayali women were well-educated, it should come as no surprise that a recent survey found that 69% of Malayali women justify domestic violence. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS), which interviewed women aged between 15-49 in both rural and urban households, reveals the justifiable reasons cited by the women to be physically punished: going out without informing the husband, making him feel suspicious, arguing with him, not looking after family and children, not respecting in-laws, not cooking well and not agreeing to sex.Why does this happen in Kerala, where the women’s education levels are the highest in the country? Is there no correlation between education and awareness of one’s rights and self-respect? We ask experts.Aliyamma Sakhi, founder, SakhiFirst of all, I don’t think the statistics is entirely correct. In our studies, around 30-35% women would justify domestic violence, at the most, not 69%. But yes, a lot of women are not at all conscious of their rights. We have come across women who ask, ‘If we tread the wrong path, how is it wrong to get beaten?’ and say, ‘We should be the ones adjusting’. Even women police officers used to say until recently during training sessions, ‘Occasional beatings are no big deal’.Marriage itself is an age-wise contract in our society. There used to be a 10-year age gap between husband and wife in the past, which is coming down now. And the husband is addressed as ‘chettan’, connoting an elderly person who should protect her, and also has the right to punish her. This has been internalised by many women and the ones who consider themselves equals are still a minority.Our visual media culture, especially TV serials, still perpetrate traditional norms about women and relationships. Nowhere are children taught that husband and wife have the same rights and are equal in a relationship.Ashley NP, Asst Professor, St Stephen’s College, DelhiIn our society, women are considered the custodians of the house but yet they are not given the power over it. They can be beaten up any time. The domestic space has never been addressed or included in any of our social or political movements and election manifestos address only issues in public spaces. A society free of dowry might be an election agenda but never one free of domestic violence. The attitude towards domestic violence will change only if this changes.The violence works on the belief that the perpetrator can get away with it, that the woman is his property. Our movies constantly give out the same message, one slap from the husband at the end and everything becomes alright. The message that women should communicate to the husband should be loud and clear – that he doesn’t have power over her. That his power comes from the work that she does inside the house. In my opinion, a slap back will put across this message in 60% of the cases, unless the man is a psychopath or something. Police intervention is not really practical every time, unless there are dedicated women police stations.Maala Parvathy, actor and psychologistFrom my experience in counselling, I have noticed that for a lot of men, physical violence is the mode of reaction whenever they get hurt or angry. When you feel angry at a child, you just hit it and silence it. Both boys and girls grow up seeing this and that’s the same method men use against women later in life.Also, our source of morality class is still TV serials. I remember an incident when my son, then just two years old, was watching a serial along with the maid. On watching a scene, he immediately said, ‘she will get beaten today’. Such is the effect of serials on our minds.We often hear the usage ‘avante pennu’. That is how a woman is introduced and that becomes her identity. When someone visits a house, they ask for ‘chettan’ for any issue that matters. Even though Malayali women are educated, they are still not expected to take important decisions. The woman’s education is meant only to aid the family’s needs, not for the freedom of her soul or self-expression.It’s not surprising that these women find fault with the woman if a husband develops suspicions about her. Why does she have to go out without his permission, is the question they ask. Also, an abused woman will never get support to walk out from a relationship from other women. The only woman to do so will be someone who says she doesn’t want anyone’s support.There are women who are suppressed and abused in all countries. But they all try to fight it out while we still prefer to suffer. We haven’t started to speak out, yet. The only solution is the right kind of education. Women have to see the world more, move out of their orbits. It’s something one has to do oneself, consciously.Ranjith Marar, AdvocateForget about a husband-wife relationship. In our society, it’s completely acceptable for a brother to beat up a sister or control her. The parents don’t react and it gets into the subconscious mind of both children that it’s acceptable. The issue begins with parenting. Also, the education we give is job-oriented. The idea that marriage is for fulfilment is alien to them and in Kerala, women are educated only to get married.A lot of Malayali women are shockingly unaware of their rights. In a marriage, neither party, especially the women are aware that they are equals. These women feel that the husband is the earning member and so he deserves respect, because he is looking after her. He has the right to domestic violence as well, automatically. There is also a lack of value-based education. The women don’t recognise their own value; that as a human being you have to respect your body.In my experience, a woman approaches a lawyer with a domestic violence case only after she reaches a point where she can’t take it anymore. In such situations we have never suggested a compromise, although we have suggested a second chance even for adultery. There have been cases when women have been beaten up even for questioning homosexuality. But out of the 500 or 1,000 cases of domestic violence, only one or two go for divorce. The rest sort it out.The root of the issue is that the women think they want protection. If they are not protected, someone will take advantage of them, they feel. It’s a vicious cycle. If they feel that the law will protect them, that the society will protect them, and they are capable of protecting themselves, they will never put up with domestic violence. There is also the question what will society think if they complain. In my opinion, I don’t think marriages are that worthy.Ardra Balachandran, researcher in gender studiesIt is definitely a result of cultural conditioning. From the time girls are born, they are told directly and indirectly that men and their wishes matter more. It’s no wonder they grow up to become women who think it is their husbands' right to beat them if they don't cook well or agree to have sex. Unless we bring up our girls giving them space to think freely, express opinions and take decisions for themselves, nothing much will change.The survey says that women in villages condone domestic violence more. So exposure is the key. When you have a chance to go outside your cocoon and meet other people, you have better chances of overcoming this cultural conditioning. You see and figure out that there are better ways to live than in drudgery.</td>\n",

       "0  What gives someone the right to comment on what happens behind a closed bedroom door?Why curb people’s natural sexual orientations with laws like IPC section 377? The reason is nothing but unequal rights and as long as it remains so, sexual preferences will remain a subject that’s constantly talked about, says Delhi-based choreographer Mandeep Raikhy. And he has not just been talking about it, but protesting against it through his creative medium, dance.Mandeep’s creation titled Queen-size, a travelling contemporary dance performance that was staged across 21 cities for 52 performances last year, will be organised in Kochi in association with Queerala this weekend. The show involves two men, dancer Lalit Khatana and Mandeep himself, who engage with each other over a charpoy and the two-hour 30 minutes show plays out in three loops of 45 minutes each. Apparently, it even invites the audience to move around during the play, watch it from different positions or even enter and leave any time they like!“The performance has a non-linear narrative and we use our bodies to convey the physical and emotional connection between two male bodies. There is no story-line and each of the loops has similarities, but also differences in the way we improvise, set the background and more. We dance to a sound score that resonates the pulse of the body,” explains Mandeep, who has reasons to not work in a traditional format. “I have worked with a few such productions and they have their limitations. I want to take it to the maximum audience possible, and for that, I guess such a format is what suits the best,” he explains. Queen-size, as it can be guessed, refers to the size of the bed. “The performance poses questions around spectatorship, privacy and dissent, deliberately making this encounter visible,” says Mandeep, who has a BA (Hons) in dance theatre from London and has worked with Shobana Jeyasingh Dance Company for several years. Some of his other famed works include Geometry and Antenne.A gay man himself, he felt inspired to come up with Queen-size after reading a write-up by the late gay activist Nishit Saran in 2000, which was titled Why My Bedroom Habits Are Your Business. “It might have been written about 18 years ago, but is still relevant and I feel deeply connected with the issues and causes he wrote about. As for our performance, the reactions we get from different people range from transformation to anger. There are also those who came up to us saying they felt baffled, uncomfortable and more,” openly admits the artiste, who has been to Kerala as part of the International Theatre Fest in 2016.

       "4  Imagine these real life scenarios:A woman who is a graduate and employed as an HR coordinator says: A classmate of mine was found dead within a week of marriage. The husband had apparently hit her in a fit of rage. But he didn’t really mean to kill her, and she must have said something to provoke him, knowing her.A lady doctor tells a divorcee friend who walked out of a marriage following extreme violence: “To stay or not to stay in a marriage is a choice. If I were in your place, I might have stayed.”An MA student from a reputed university in the country says during a classroom discussion about women in cinema: “I don’t think the Malayalam film where Mohanlal talks about wanting a wife to kick when he gets home is sexist. After all, it would be every woman’s fantasy to be kicked by her man, at least once.”Considering that all these Malayali women were well-educated, it should come as no surprise that a recent survey found that 69% of Malayali women justify domestic violence. The National Family Health Survey (NFHS), which interviewed women aged between 15-49 in both rural and urban households, reveals the justifiable reasons cited by the women to be physically punished: going out without informing the husband, making him feel suspicious, arguing with him, not looking after family and children, not respecting in-laws, not cooking well and not agreeing to sex.Why does this happen in Kerala, where the women’s education levels are the highest in the country? Is there no correlation between education and awareness of one’s rights and self-respect? We ask experts.Aliyamma Sakhi, founder, SakhiFirst of all, I don’t think the statistics is entirely correct. In our studies, around 30-35% women would justify domestic violence, at the most, not 69%. But yes, a lot of women are not at all conscious of their rights. We have come across women who ask, ‘If we tread the wrong path, how is it wrong to get beaten?’ and say, ‘We should be the ones adjusting’. Even women police officers used to say until recently during training sessions, ‘Occasional beatings are no big deal’.Marriage itself is an age-wise contract in our society. There used to be a 10-year age gap between husband and wife in the past, which is coming down now. And the husband is addressed as ‘chettan’, connoting an elderly person who should protect her, and also has the right to punish her. This has been internalised by many women and the ones who consider themselves equals are still a minority.Our visual media culture, especially TV serials, still perpetrate traditional norms about women and relationships. Nowhere are children taught that husband and wife have the same rights and are equal in a relationship.Ashley NP, Asst Professor, St Stephen’s College, DelhiIn our society, women are considered the custodians of the house but yet they are not given the power over it. They can be beaten up any time. The domestic space has never been addressed or included in any of our social or political movements and election manifestos address only issues in public spaces. A society free of dowry might be an election agenda but never one free of domestic violence. The attitude towards domestic violence will change only if this changes.The violence works on the belief that the perpetrator can get away with it, that the woman is his property. Our movies constantly give out the same message, one slap from the husband at the end and everything becomes alright. The message that women should communicate to the husband should be loud and clear – that he doesn’t have power over her. That his power comes from the work that she does inside the house. In my opinion, a slap back will put across this message in 60% of the cases, unless the man is a psychopath or something. Police intervention is not really practical every time, unless there are dedicated women police stations.Maala Parvathy, actor and psychologistFrom my experience in counselling, I have noticed that for a lot of men, physical violence is the mode of reaction whenever they get hurt or angry. When you feel angry at a child, you just hit it and silence it. Both boys and girls grow up seeing this and that’s the same method men use against women later in life.Also, our source of morality class is still TV serials. I remember an incident when my son, then just two years old, was watching a serial along with the maid. On watching a scene, he immediately said, ‘she will get beaten today’. Such is the effect of serials on our minds.We often hear the usage ‘avante pennu’. That is how a woman is introduced and that becomes her identity. When someone visits a house, they ask for ‘chettan’ for any issue that matters. Even though Malayali women are educated, they are still not expected to take important decisions. The woman’s education is meant only to aid the family’s needs, not for the freedom of her soul or self-expression.It’s not surprising that these women find fault with the woman if a husband develops suspicions about her. Why does she have to go out without his permission, is the question they ask. Also, an abused woman will never get support to walk out from a relationship from other women. The only woman to do so will be someone who says she doesn’t want anyone’s support.There are women who are suppressed and abused in all countries. But they all try to fight it out while we still prefer to suffer. We haven’t started to speak out, yet. The only solution is the right kind of education. Women have to see the world more, move out of their orbits. It’s something one has to do oneself, consciously.Ranjith Marar, AdvocateForget about a husband-wife relationship. In our society, it’s completely acceptable for a brother to beat up a sister or control her. The parents don’t react and it gets into the subconscious mind of both children that it’s acceptable. The issue begins with parenting. Also, the education we give is job-oriented. The idea that marriage is for fulfilment is alien to them and in Kerala, women are educated only to get married.A lot of Malayali women are shockingly unaware of their rights. In a marriage, neither party, especially the women are aware that they are equals. These women feel that the husband is the earning member and so he deserves respect, because he is looking after her. He has the right to domestic violence as well, automatically. There is also a lack of value-based education. The women don’t recognise their own value; that as a human being you have to respect your body.In my experience, a woman approaches a lawyer with a domestic violence case only after she reaches a point where she can’t take it anymore. In such situations we have never suggested a compromise, although we have suggested a second chance even for adultery. There have been cases when women have been beaten up even for questioning homosexuality. But out of the 500 or 1,000 cases of domestic violence, only one or two go for divorce. The rest sort it out.The root of the issue is that the women think they want protection. If they are not protected, someone will take advantage of them, they feel. It’s a vicious cycle. If they feel that the law will protect them, that the society will protect them, and they are capable of protecting themselves, they will never put up with domestic violence. There is also the question what will society think if they complain. In my opinion, I don’t think marriages are that worthy.Ardra Balachandran, researcher in gender studiesIt is definitely a result of cultural conditioning. From the time girls are born, they are told directly and indirectly that men and their wishes matter more. It’s no wonder they grow up to become women who think it is their husbands' right to beat them if they don't cook well or agree to have sex. Unless we bring up our girls giving them space to think freely, express opinions and take decisions for themselves, nothing much will change.The survey says that women in villages condone domestic violence more. So exposure is the key. When you have a chance to go outside your cocoon and meet other people, you have better chances of overcoming this cultural conditioning. You see and figure out that there are better ways to live than in drudgery.  "

Called Rendezvous... Connecting The Dots, the performance, which is structured like a play, is an experiment of how meaningful conversations can emerge between movement, classical singing and theatre.“Gayatri and Sujata got together up last year for a performance, and this year, we put our heads together to see how all three of us could collaborate. We thought, let’s use literature as well, and went through a lot of great works, from The Little Prince, the works of MT Vasudevan Nair and Mahabharata, which we have incorporated in the performance,” says Rajesh.The piece looks at the disconnect that exists today, thanks to our addiction to technology. “Because we are on our gadgets all the time, we are not looking at what is out there — at art in everyday life. This is a process to sensitize ourselves to the larger art out there,” adds Rajesh.Rendezvous… speaks about a variety of issues, from sexual harassment to child abuse and more. “We take a peek into the Mahabharata — into the molestation and the apathy around it. There is also a piece about women reclaiming their space, in which a female actor asks, ‘Who has a tampon?’ and a tampon magically appears. It’s a lot like how one would casually ask for a cigarette. There are multiple layers within a larger performance, and how art can bring them to the foreground,” says Rajesh.The non-ticketed work-in-progress performance will be staged this evening at Lahe Lahe, which will be followed by an informal interaction with the audience to get their viewpoints. The aim, says Rajesh, is to develop the performance further to stage it this time next year.</td>\n",

However, when I was signing this show, I was in two minds on how can I play a mother to a grown up at this stage in my career but then I surrendered to the character sketch, which is quite powerful.

       "4  Dancer Gayatri Ganapathy, Hindustani singer Sujata Iyer and Rajesh PI of The Actors Collective are collaborating for a unique performance that will see Gayatri dancing, Sujata singing live and seven of Rajesh’s actors. Called Rendezvous... Connecting The Dots, the performance, which is structured like a play, is an experiment of how meaningful conversations can emerge between movement, classical singing and theatre.“Gayatri and Sujata got together up last year for a performance, and this year, we put our heads together to see how all three of us could collaborate. We thought, let’s use literature as well, and went through a lot of great works, from The Little Prince, the works of MT Vasudevan Nair and Mahabharata, which we have incorporated in the performance,” says Rajesh.The piece looks at the disconnect that exists today, thanks to our addiction to technology. “Because we are on our gadgets all the time, we are not looking at what is out there — at art in everyday life. This is a process to sensitize ourselves to the larger art out there,” adds Rajesh.Rendezvous… speaks about a variety of issues, from sexual harassment to child abuse and more. “We take a peek into the Mahabharata — into the molestation and the apathy around it. There is also a piece about women reclaiming their space, in which a female actor asks, ‘Who has a tampon?’ and a tampon magically appears. It’s a lot like how one would casually ask for a cigarette. There are multiple layers within a larger performance, and how art can bring them to the foreground,” says Rajesh.The non-ticketed work-in-progress performance will be staged this evening at Lahe Lahe, which will be followed by an informal interaction with the audience to get their viewpoints. The aim, says Rajesh, is to develop the performance further to stage it this time next year.  "

       "      <td>Saisharan, who shot to fame after being part of the popular reality show, Super Singer on Vijay TV, has gone on to become a professional playback singer, trying his hand with many young music directors. But not many know his Carnatic side. “Carnatic music is my home ground,” begins Saisharan, adding, “I started learning Carnatic music when I was five years old and did my arangetram at eight. After a few years, I gradually started drifting towards film music. I am happy to get opportunities to perform Carnatic concerts.”Saisharan says that becoming a playback singer was an accident. “I started my playback singing career when I was 18 and it’s been seven years now. But I must admit that I haven’t had a great run in playback singing. I am still waiting for a good opportunity and breakthrough. It has been a learning phase for me. The biggest challenge about playback singing is getting the right break at the right time.” He adds, “Initially, I found it difficult to bring out the emotions in the song. If you are able to make the audience empathise with the number, you are successful.”Saisharan’s latest song is in Vijay Sethupathi’s upcoming release Oru Nalla Naal Pathu Solren, which has music by Justin Prabhakaran. “I’ve sung a song with Nikita Gandhi. Justin guided me throughout the song and gave me freedom to experiment.”The singer believes that it is extremely difficult for a playback singer to survive in the field today. He says, “Karthik is probably the last singer who could sing most of the songs in his time. After that, Haricharan got a huge chunk of songs for five years. The story after that has been different. There are many singers in the picture today and there is a massive competition. You can’t survive exclusively as a singer and hence, have to try your hand in different industries and across different platforms (online, independent albums). The lifespan of a singer’s career has gotten shorter.”But Saisharan is thankful that he has experimented a bit. “I would like to be looked at as an artist who can perform everything. My only aim is to sing for AR Rahman sir,” he says.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Trained as a Carnatic singer, but inspired by pop and EDM, Sangeetha Rajeev, also known as SaRa, is a multilingual playback singer, composer, and independent musician from Bengaluru. Aspiring to be a Bharatanatyam dancer when she was young, Sangeetha’s dreams came crashing down after a tragic accident. “I am a trained Bharatanatyam dancer and wanted to make it my career and perform worldwide. But when I fell off from the roof of my uncle’s house, the doctor told me I had a spinal injury and will not be able to perform ever again. I slipped into depression and felt like I lost everything I had,” says Sangeetha.Seeking to come out of her trauma, Sangeetha chose a career as a software engineer and moved to London on work. Realizing that being a software engineer is not what she wanted to do and that her passion was to perform, she decided to become an independent musician. “Being the daughter of a singer, I was trained in classical music as a child. I knew I had to give music a chance, since it is in my genes. So, I began learning Hindustani classical music and other forms of music, and started performing on my own,” says Sangeetha. After all the hard work, she released her first Kannada album, called Sarvasva, in 2015. And thus began her musical career.Sangeetha has come a long way since. She started off by being an independent musician and then turned playback singer in the Kannada film industry; she has sung for a number of films. She recently made inroads into the Telugu film industry with the Birthday Song from Rangula Raatnam. Despite being a playback singer, Sangeetha says that she has not given up on being an independent musician. She adds that independent music in the country has almost vanished and that there are very few artistes who are trying to keep it alive. “If you listen to radio or watch television, all you hear and see are film songs. I want to change that by introducing independent music to a larger audience. I also want to revive the 90s pop culture,” she says.And that is what her new song, Kare, is about, which, she says, is among the first EDM pop singles in Kannada. It’s a romantic number and is dedicated to all those who are in love. When we ask her why she chose EDM and pop, Sangeetha adds, “It’s an effort to revive the pop music culture in India. Pop music and independent artistes ruled the industry in the 90s in India, but now they are vanishing. To change that, my aim is to release several singles — in Kannada, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu — in the near future.” Sangeetha adds that Kare will also be released in Hindi as Tu Hi.</td>\n",

       "0  Saisharan, who shot to fame after being part of the popular reality show, Super Singer on Vijay TV, has gone on to become a professional playback singer, trying his hand with many young music directors. But not many know his Carnatic side. “Carnatic music is my home ground,” begins Saisharan, adding, “I started learning Carnatic music when I was five years old and did my arangetram at eight. After a few years, I gradually started drifting towards film music. I am happy to get opportunities to perform Carnatic concerts.”Saisharan says that becoming a playback singer was an accident. “I started my playback singing career when I was 18 and it’s been seven years now. But I must admit that I haven’t had a great run in playback singing. I am still waiting for a good opportunity and breakthrough. It has been a learning phase for me. The biggest challenge about playback singing is getting the right break at the right time.” He adds, “Initially, I found it difficult to bring out the emotions in the song. If you are able to make the audience empathise with the number, you are successful.”Saisharan’s latest song is in Vijay Sethupathi’s upcoming release Oru Nalla Naal Pathu Solren, which has music by Justin Prabhakaran. “I’ve sung a song with Nikita Gandhi. Justin guided me throughout the song and gave me freedom to experiment.”The singer believes that it is extremely difficult for a playback singer to survive in the field today. He says, “Karthik is probably the last singer who could sing most of the songs in his time. After that, Haricharan got a huge chunk of songs for five years. The story after that has been different. There are many singers in the picture today and there is a massive competition. You can’t survive exclusively as a singer and hence, have to try your hand in different industries and across different platforms (online, independent albums). The lifespan of a singer’s career has gotten shorter.”But Saisharan is thankful that he has experimented a bit. “I would like to be looked at as an artist who can perform everything. My only aim is to sing for AR Rahman sir,” he says.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",

       "2  Trained as a Carnatic singer, but inspired by pop and EDM, Sangeetha Rajeev, also known as SaRa, is a multilingual playback singer, composer, and independent musician from Bengaluru. Aspiring to be a Bharatanatyam dancer when she was young, Sangeetha’s dreams came crashing down after a tragic accident. “I am a trained Bharatanatyam dancer and wanted to make it my career and perform worldwide. But when I fell off from the roof of my uncle’s house, the doctor told me I had a spinal injury and will not be able to perform ever again. I slipped into depression and felt like I lost everything I had,” says Sangeetha.Seeking to come out of her trauma, Sangeetha chose a career as a software engineer and moved to London on work. Realizing that being a software engineer is not what she wanted to do and that her passion was to perform, she decided to become an independent musician. “Being the daughter of a singer, I was trained in classical music as a child. I knew I had to give music a chance, since it is in my genes. So, I began learning Hindustani classical music and other forms of music, and started performing on my own,” says Sangeetha. After all the hard work, she released her first Kannada album, called Sarvasva, in 2015. And thus began her musical career.Sangeetha has come a long way since. She started off by being an independent musician and then turned playback singer in the Kannada film industry; she has sung for a number of films. She recently made inroads into the Telugu film industry with the Birthday Song from Rangula Raatnam. Despite being a playback singer, Sangeetha says that she has not given up on being an independent musician. She adds that independent music in the country has almost vanished and that there are very few artistes who are trying to keep it alive. “If you listen to radio or watch television, all you hear and see are film songs. I want to change that by introducing independent music to a larger audience. I also want to revive the 90s pop culture,” she says.And that is what her new song, Kare, is about, which, she says, is among the first EDM pop singles in Kannada. It’s a romantic number and is dedicated to all those who are in love. When we ask her why she chose EDM and pop, Sangeetha adds, “It’s an effort to revive the pop music culture in India. Pop music and independent artistes ruled the industry in the 90s in India, but now they are vanishing. To change that, my aim is to release several singles — in Kannada, Hindi, Tamil and Telugu — in the near future.” Sangeetha adds that Kare will also be released in Hindi as Tu Hi.  \n",

       "      <td>When director Naresh Kumar wrote the script of Raju Kannada Medium, he knew that the film required a lot of work in terms of computer graphics. It would be a daunting task, but what gave him the confidence to go ahead was the fact that producer KA Suresh of Suresh Arts supported him unconditonally. Not only did he give Naresh the go ahead to do whatever necessary for the film, but Suresh also got the graphics team that worked on Baahubali on board to get the best output. “In the second half, the story transpires on an island. From a plane crash to a shark attack and more, pretty much everything had to be created in a design studio. I had a storyboard ready for each and every sequence and gave the designers images to explain what I wanted. We did the same with Gurunandan as well, especially for the underwater sequence, which has a shark attack. He was told about the reactions expected of him and once we had shot that, we took that footage to the graphic designers to work on the shark It wasn't easy and we took at least six months to reach perfection. There was a lot of to and fro, but we got exactly what we wanted,” says Naresh.Audience reaction to the sequence on the island, adds the filmmaker has been good, with many voicing surprise that it has all been created digitally. “People know that we could not have shot with an actual shark, but many assumed that there was real footage mixed with our sequence. That’s the quality that we have brought onscreen and it gives us great pride that people have compared it to Hollywood standards,” he says.</td>\n",

The book fair is an added bonus.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
       "3  When director Naresh Kumar wrote the script of Raju Kannada Medium, he knew that the film required a lot of work in terms of computer graphics. It would be a daunting task, but what gave him the confidence to go ahead was the fact that producer KA Suresh of Suresh Arts supported him unconditonally. Not only did he give Naresh the go ahead to do whatever necessary for the film, but Suresh also got the graphics team that worked on Baahubali on board to get the best output. “In the second half, the story transpires on an island. From a plane crash to a shark attack and more, pretty much everything had to be created in a design studio. I had a storyboard ready for each and every sequence and gave the designers images to explain what I wanted. We did the same with Gurunandan as well, especially for the underwater sequence, which has a shark attack. He was told about the reactions expected of him and once we had shot that, we took that footage to the graphic designers to work on the shark It wasn't easy and we took at least six months to reach perfection. There was a lot of to and fro, but we got exactly what we wanted,” says Naresh.Audience reaction to the sequence on the island, adds the filmmaker has been good, with many voicing surprise that it has all been created digitally. “People know that we could not have shot with an actual shark, but many assumed that there was real footage mixed with our sequence. That’s the quality that we have brought onscreen and it gives us great pride that people have compared it to Hollywood standards,” he says.  \n",

       "      <td>This IT guy chose to pursue his acting dreams</td>\n",
       "      <td>His is a typical case of an IT professional whose passion lies in the arts — theatre, television and films. “I’ve always had a flair for acting but opted for a conventional career in the IT sector given its financial security. But I wasn’t satisfied doing a 9-to-5 job. Circumstances too conspired and when I got the opportunity to work according to US timings, I got plenty of time on my hand. Until 3 in the noon I was free to pursue my first love,” shares Ram Manjjonath. Theatre is his mainstay and Ram has been part of plays like Basava Express, Uttarabhoopa Beechi, 8/15, Huttadalli Hutta and Vicharane Naditide among others. “Then came the opportunity to do teleserials. Paapa Pandu was a rage then and I was lucky to kickstart my television career with that serial. This was way back in 2004. Then after a brief hiatus, I did Geetanjali followed by a tele play for Doordarshan which is telecast every year during Gandhi Jayanthi — it is based on the freedom struggle,” shares Ram. He also did Hushar Karnataka, a programme on crime followed by Shantam Paapam. “In Shantam Paapam, they never enlist actors more than once. But I was called twice to be part of the project,” he tells us. Ram then did Neeli which required him for a long stint. “I played a seer in it and that was interesting,” he avers. Ram’s most recent stint was Yugale Geethe. “I was doing the casting for the serial when the makers whom I’m close to suggested that I play a part. So I did that,” smiles Ram. He has also been part of films that include U-turn, Srinivasa Kalyana, Jeerjimbe, Lucia and Badmaash. “For me whether it’s TV, films or theatre, the medium is immaterial. I love the fact that I get to play so many different personalities and that is gratifying. After all, how many IT engineers get the opportunity to act? I’m glad I have the best of both worlds,” sums up Ram.</td>\n",

       "4  His is a typical case of an IT professional whose passion lies in the arts — theatre, television and films. “I’ve always had a flair for acting but opted for a conventional career in the IT sector given its financial security. But I wasn’t satisfied doing a 9-to-5 job. Circumstances too conspired and when I got the opportunity to work according to US timings, I got plenty of time on my hand. Until 3 in the noon I was free to pursue my first love,” shares Ram Manjjonath. Theatre is his mainstay and Ram has been part of plays like Basava Express, Uttarabhoopa Beechi, 8/15, Huttadalli Hutta and Vicharane Naditide among others. “Then came the opportunity to do teleserials. Paapa Pandu was a rage then and I was lucky to kickstart my television career with that serial. This was way back in 2004. Then after a brief hiatus, I did Geetanjali followed by a tele play for Doordarshan which is telecast every year during Gandhi Jayanthi — it is based on the freedom struggle,” shares Ram. He also did Hushar Karnataka, a programme on crime followed by Shantam Paapam. “In Shantam Paapam, they never enlist actors more than once. But I was called twice to be part of the project,” he tells us. Ram then did Neeli which required him for a long stint. “I played a seer in it and that was interesting,” he avers. Ram’s most recent stint was Yugale Geethe. “I was doing the casting for the serial when the makers whom I’m close to suggested that I play a part. So I did that,” smiles Ram. He has also been part of films that include U-turn, Srinivasa Kalyana, Jeerjimbe, Lucia and Badmaash. “For me whether it’s TV, films or theatre, the medium is immaterial. I love the fact that I get to play so many different personalities and that is gratifying. After all, how many IT engineers get the opportunity to act? I’m glad I have the best of both worlds,” sums up Ram.  "

They will be in police custody till Thursday.Of the 17 vehicles recovered, police have identified the complainants in 15 cases. The process of identifying the owners of the two other vehicles is in progress.A special team led by inspector Anjum Bagwan under assistant commissioner of police (Wanowrie division) Milind Patil arrested the suspects following a tip-off. Deputy commissioner of police (zone IV) Deepak Sakore had issued instructions to the team to crack down on criminals involved in stealing vehicles and disposing them of in Pune and Ahmednagar districts among other places after investigations revealed that local criminals were not involved in the series of vehicle thefts in the city.The teams visited villages and weekly bazaars at various districts and identified the suspects involved in selling stolen vehicles at a cheap rate. They also identified people using vehicles with the same or changed registration number or without number plates.The team has been credited with busting four gangs comprising two members each and recovering 49 vehicles — all two-wheelers — since January 9. More stolen vehicles are expected to be recovered in the days to come.The modus operandi of the gang was stealing motorcycles from various parts of the city using duplicate keys. The gang members would then dispose of the stolen vehicles to known people at a cheap rate. Some vehicles were also used for joyrides and kept with acquaintances.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On the night of January 31, we will witness a rarest of rare celestial phenomenon in the sky, claimed to occur after 150 years! And it is going to be a triple treat as the sky will have a supermoon, a blue Moon and a total lunar eclipse, all at the same time. The sky watchers in the State are all geared up to witness the delightful experience, as it is said to be best visible here.“It is going to be a wonderful phenomenon for Keralites as we will be able to witness it all together, very clearly, especially in the coastal regions. Let’s not miss it,” says Jayant Ganguli, technical officer, Regional Science Centre and Planetarium, Kozhikode. He explains the phenomenon better.“On January 31, the Moon is going to be bigger, brighter and more beautiful. As the Moon revolves around the earth in an oval orbit, there will be a time when it comes closer to the Earth and becomes a full Moon. It is also a lunar eclipse as the sun, Earth and Moon are aligned to form a straight line. Also, the Moon will turn reddish so we call it the red Moon or blood Moon. The colour may vary from brown to red depending on the atmospheric humidity and pollution.”The partial shadow on the Moon would be seen at 4.21 pm, while the complete lunar eclipse would be visible at 6.21 pm. “It will be brown or red in colour. The Moon will emerge from the complete lunar eclipse at 7.37 pm, and will turn into a partial one by 8.41 pm. Then the Moon will be fully visible once again,” he says, adding that Moon watching programmes have been organised across the state. “At the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium, Kozhikode, we will have a mass observation programme. It will be clearly visible to the naked eye, but we will also allow sky watchers to use our telescopes,” he adds. The Priyadarshini Planetarium in the Kerala Science and Technology Museum (KSSTM), Thiruvananthapuram, is also making arrangements for people to witness this celestial event.Meanwhile, according to astrologers, the lunar eclipse will have an impact on the star signs and special pujas should be done. “Indian astrology does not consider blood Moon. However, the lunar eclipse that comes along with it is very special as it will be a total lunar eclipse of 99.8%. January 31 is 17th of Makaram month and it will be good to do special chandrapuja on the day. It is advisable not to have food for four and a half hours post the eclipse,” says astrologer J Sreekumar.When it comes to Western astrology, one will experience a transformation following the eclipse. “A global change in female energy will occur and feminine power will become stronger. However, one should be very careful as deep inner fears will surface during an eclipse. Suicidal tendencies are possible. But once you conquer the fears, happiness will follow. Try meditation to overcome it,” says Roopesh R, who specialises in spiritual subjects.Lunar TrifectaSuper Moon : A full or new Moon that is close to the Earth (3.56 lakh kilometre).The Moon appears 14% larger and 40% brighterBlue Moon :The second full Moon in a month. January 1, 2017 was a full Moon.Blood moon : Blood Moon or total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon travels through the earth’s umbra, the dark central portion of its shadow. The earth blocks all direct sunlight from falling onto the Moon’s surface.The Moon does not turn completely dark during a total lunar eclipse, and appears reddish, since part of the sunlight still reaches the lunar surface indirectly, via the earth'satmosphere.Eclipse timelinePartial shadow on Moon: 4.21 pmComplete eclipse: 6.21 - 7.37 pmPartial shadow Moon: 8.41 pmFull Moon: Post 8.41 pm</td>\n",

Some vehicles were also used for joyrides and kept with acquaintances.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "4  On the night of January 31, we will witness a rarest of rare celestial phenomenon in the sky, claimed to occur after 150 years! And it is going to be a triple treat as the sky will have a supermoon, a blue Moon and a total lunar eclipse, all at the same time. The sky watchers in the State are all geared up to witness the delightful experience, as it is said to be best visible here.“It is going to be a wonderful phenomenon for Keralites as we will be able to witness it all together, very clearly, especially in the coastal regions. Let’s not miss it,” says Jayant Ganguli, technical officer, Regional Science Centre and Planetarium, Kozhikode. He explains the phenomenon better.“On January 31, the Moon is going to be bigger, brighter and more beautiful. As the Moon revolves around the earth in an oval orbit, there will be a time when it comes closer to the Earth and becomes a full Moon. It is also a lunar eclipse as the sun, Earth and Moon are aligned to form a straight line. Also, the Moon will turn reddish so we call it the red Moon or blood Moon. The colour may vary from brown to red depending on the atmospheric humidity and pollution.”The partial shadow on the Moon would be seen at 4.21 pm, while the complete lunar eclipse would be visible at 6.21 pm. “It will be brown or red in colour. The Moon will emerge from the complete lunar eclipse at 7.37 pm, and will turn into a partial one by 8.41 pm. Then the Moon will be fully visible once again,” he says, adding that Moon watching programmes have been organised across the state. “At the Regional Science Centre and Planetarium, Kozhikode, we will have a mass observation programme. It will be clearly visible to the naked eye, but we will also allow sky watchers to use our telescopes,” he adds. The Priyadarshini Planetarium in the Kerala Science and Technology Museum (KSSTM), Thiruvananthapuram, is also making arrangements for people to witness this celestial event.Meanwhile, according to astrologers, the lunar eclipse will have an impact on the star signs and special pujas should be done. “Indian astrology does not consider blood Moon. However, the lunar eclipse that comes along with it is very special as it will be a total lunar eclipse of 99.8%. January 31 is 17th of Makaram month and it will be good to do special chandrapuja on the day. It is advisable not to have food for four and a half hours post the eclipse,” says astrologer J Sreekumar.When it comes to Western astrology, one will experience a transformation following the eclipse. “A global change in female energy will occur and feminine power will become stronger. However, one should be very careful as deep inner fears will surface during an eclipse. Suicidal tendencies are possible. But once you conquer the fears, happiness will follow. Try meditation to overcome it,” says Roopesh R, who specialises in spiritual subjects.Lunar TrifectaSuper Moon : A full or new Moon that is close to the Earth (3.56 lakh kilometre).The Moon appears 14% larger and 40% brighterBlue Moon :The second full Moon in a month. January 1, 2017 was a full Moon.Blood moon : Blood Moon or total lunar eclipse occurs when the moon travels through the earth’s umbra, the dark central portion of its shadow. The earth blocks all direct sunlight from falling onto the Moon’s surface.The Moon does not turn completely dark during a total lunar eclipse, and appears reddish, since part of the sunlight still reaches the lunar surface indirectly, via the earth'satmosphere.Eclipse timelinePartial shadow on Moon: 4.21 pmComplete eclipse: 6.21 - 7.37 pmPartial shadow Moon: 8.41 pmFull Moon: Post 8.41 pm  "

       "      <td>Empowering society through art is the theme that doctor-turned-dancer Dr Chaithanya Unni chose for her hour-long dance drama titled Indulekha. Being the great granddaughter of the prolific writer O Chandu Menon, it was his novel Indulekha that inspired her to conceive the musical.Written and directed by Soorya Krishnamoorthy, the show has been choreographed by Samudra Performing Arts with music by Pandit Ramesh Narayanan. In the well-crafted stage at Ganesham, Thycaud, in Thiruvananthapuram, the director set the plot as the house of the protagonist. The musical performance told the audience stories of women of five generations of Chandu Menon’s family and how they empowered themselves in the society.“Though the novel is known for its progressive ideas, the production is not a page-by-page adaptation of the book,” says Chaithanya, who is a dermatologist settled in Australia. “We conceptualised his thoughts of how women should take care of themselves and be independent in the society. You have to appreciate how the writers’ thoughts are still relevant.”Being a trained Mohiniyattom dancer helped her narrate the idea better, she says. On the challenges staging the play, she says, “I had to do justice to the part I play and also make sure the new style of dance production entertains the art enthusiasts.The show also had live elements such as rain and thunder that gave the audience a unique experience. The play also marks the return of actor and dancer Vineeth Kumar, who had directed Ayaal Njanalla, after a hiatus, in the role of Madhavan, Indulekha’s beau. Chaithanya says that she views the production as a cultural exchange and is now planning to take it to national and international stages.Take a look at the photos from the performance:</td>\n",

       "      <td>Veteran actress T Krishna Kumari, 84, succumbed to a prolonged battle with a terminal illness early on Wednesday morning. She had acted alongside some of the best known heroes of her times, across different industries, including Dr Rajkumar, NT Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Kanta Rao and Sivaji Ganesan. She was the sister of actress Sowcar Janaki and is survived by her daughter Dipika, son-in-law Vikram and grandson Pavan. Janaki says, “It was our mother’s wish that we spend our retired lives in each other’s company. I shifted to Bengaluru and we used to meet, go for walks and catch up. We never knew when her health complications turned fatal. Eventually, she gave up battling the prolonged illness. I’m older to her by just over a year, so we had grown up together, with great attachment to each other. I’m shattered that she is no longer with me.” She had earlier said, “My sister was the glamourous one and her movies portrayed her beauty and glamour. As a person, she has enormous patience and has single-handedly supported my mother and my siblings. I have always admired her loyalty to the family.”Krishna Kumari, who began her acting career in 1951, reached her peak over the next decade, giving memorable performances alongside the biggest superstars of her era. She is best known for her roles in mythological films. In the Kannada film industry, she acted alongside Dr Rajkumar in memorable films, including Srishaila Mahatme, Bhakta Kanakadasa and Swarna Gowri.Memories galoreIn Krishna Kumari’s memoir penned by her daughter, Dipika, that was released by her, many of her peers have recalled memories of her. Here’s presenting some of them:“It was LV Prasad who was keen to work with Krishna Kumari garu. When he produced Ilavelpu, released in 1956, he not only signed her up for the lead role, but also requested her to formally launch the film. Ilavelpu, which featured Krishna Kumari opposite Akkineni Nageswara Rao, was a super hit. In 1960, Krishna Kumari acted in Pelli Kanuka, again opposite Akkineni. She followed this with a film opposite NT Rama Rao. Vittalacharya, popular as ‘Janapada Brahma’, cast her in Voddante Pelli, an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew,” says film historian SV Rama Rao. “Again, a success! Vittalacharya went on to direct about 25 folklore movies, several of which starred Krishna Kumari and NT Rama Rao, including Bandipotu, Irugu Porugu and Chikkadu Dorakadu,” says Rama Rao. Late superstar Akkineni Nageswara Rao had said, “In my long career in the film industry, I have worked with many important, talented and wonderful heroines. Krishna Kumari is one of them — a beautiful and expressive heroine. We have worked in several movies together and one of them is Bharya Bhartalu, a heroine-oriented film, where she plays the lead role. She was known for being extremely co-operative and for being a director's heroine.”Famed actress B Saroja Devi recalls, “Krishna and I have worked together in Pelli Kanuka as sisters, and later in Rahasyam. I consider her as one of my closest friends. For as long as we lived in Madras, we were also neighbours and visited each other’s homes often. I knew her family members and she knew mine. When the studios shifted to Hyderabad, we would schedule some of our travels together. Boarding the Dakota aircraft in Madras (Chennai), we would would talk non-stop until we landed in Hyderabad. Of Krishna, I can say that I have never seen her angry. She assumed responsibility of her family and took care of every single member cheerfully. It must have demanded enormous sacrifices, but she did it.”Multilingual star Sridevi, who has worked with her as a child artiste, had written, “I was a child when I worked with her and she was a big star. And I remember feeling that a princess had entered the room when she came onto the sets. She was soft spoken, always smiling and with such a sweet voice... tall and graceful, she had a presence about her. Working with her was always a pleasant experience.”</td>\n",

       "1  Empowering society through art is the theme that doctor-turned-dancer Dr Chaithanya Unni chose for her hour-long dance drama titled Indulekha. Being the great granddaughter of the prolific writer O Chandu Menon, it was his novel Indulekha that inspired her to conceive the musical.Written and directed by Soorya Krishnamoorthy, the show has been choreographed by Samudra Performing Arts with music by Pandit Ramesh Narayanan. In the well-crafted stage at Ganesham, Thycaud, in Thiruvananthapuram, the director set the plot as the house of the protagonist. The musical performance told the audience stories of women of five generations of Chandu Menon’s family and how they empowered themselves in the society.“Though the novel is known for its progressive ideas, the production is not a page-by-page adaptation of the book,” says Chaithanya, who is a dermatologist settled in Australia. “We conceptualised his thoughts of how women should take care of themselves and be independent in the society. You have to appreciate how the writers’ thoughts are still relevant.”Being a trained Mohiniyattom dancer helped her narrate the idea better, she says. On the challenges staging the play, she says, “I had to do justice to the part I play and also make sure the new style of dance production entertains the art enthusiasts.The show also had live elements such as rain and thunder that gave the audience a unique experience. The play also marks the return of actor and dancer Vineeth Kumar, who had directed Ayaal Njanalla, after a hiatus, in the role of Madhavan, Indulekha’s beau. Chaithanya says that she views the production as a cultural exchange and is now planning to take it to national and international stages.Take a look at the photos from the performance:                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n",
       "2  Veteran actress T Krishna Kumari, 84, succumbed to a prolonged battle with a terminal illness early on Wednesday morning. She had acted alongside some of the best known heroes of her times, across different industries, including Dr Rajkumar, NT Rama Rao, Akkineni Nageswara Rao, Kanta Rao and Sivaji Ganesan. She was the sister of actress Sowcar Janaki and is survived by her daughter Dipika, son-in-law Vikram and grandson Pavan. Janaki says, “It was our mother’s wish that we spend our retired lives in each other’s company. I shifted to Bengaluru and we used to meet, go for walks and catch up. We never knew when her health complications turned fatal. Eventually, she gave up battling the prolonged illness. I’m older to her by just over a year, so we had grown up together, with great attachment to each other. I’m shattered that she is no longer with me.” She had earlier said, “My sister was the glamourous one and her movies portrayed her beauty and glamour. As a person, she has enormous patience and has single-handedly supported my mother and my siblings. I have always admired her loyalty to the family.”Krishna Kumari, who began her acting career in 1951, reached her peak over the next decade, giving memorable performances alongside the biggest superstars of her era. She is best known for her roles in mythological films. In the Kannada film industry, she acted alongside Dr Rajkumar in memorable films, including Srishaila Mahatme, Bhakta Kanakadasa and Swarna Gowri.Memories galoreIn Krishna Kumari’s memoir penned by her daughter, Dipika, that was released by her, many of her peers have recalled memories of her. Here’s presenting some of them:“It was LV Prasad who was keen to work with Krishna Kumari garu. When he produced Ilavelpu, released in 1956, he not only signed her up for the lead role, but also requested her to formally launch the film. Ilavelpu, which featured Krishna Kumari opposite Akkineni Nageswara Rao, was a super hit. In 1960, Krishna Kumari acted in Pelli Kanuka, again opposite Akkineni. She followed this with a film opposite NT Rama Rao. Vittalacharya, popular as ‘Janapada Brahma’, cast her in Voddante Pelli, an adaptation of The Taming of the Shrew,” says film historian SV Rama Rao. “Again, a success! Vittalacharya went on to direct about 25 folklore movies, several of which starred Krishna Kumari and NT Rama Rao, including Bandipotu, Irugu Porugu and Chikkadu Dorakadu,” says Rama Rao. Late superstar Akkineni Nageswara Rao had said, “In my long career in the film industry, I have worked with many important, talented and wonderful heroines. Krishna Kumari is one of them — a beautiful and expressive heroine. We have worked in several movies together and one of them is Bharya Bhartalu, a heroine-oriented film, where she plays the lead role. She was known for being extremely co-operative and for being a director's heroine.”Famed actress B Saroja Devi recalls, “Krishna and I have worked together in Pelli Kanuka as sisters, and later in Rahasyam. I consider her as one of my closest friends. For as long as we lived in Madras, we were also neighbours and visited each other’s homes often. I knew her family members and she knew mine. When the studios shifted to Hyderabad, we would schedule some of our travels together. Boarding the Dakota aircraft in Madras (Chennai), we would would talk non-stop until we landed in Hyderabad. Of Krishna, I can say that I have never seen her angry. She assumed responsibility of her family and took care of every single member cheerfully. It must have demanded enormous sacrifices, but she did it.”Multilingual star Sridevi, who has worked with her as a child artiste, had written, “I was a child when I worked with her and she was a big star. And I remember feeling that a princess had entered the room when she came onto the sets. She was soft spoken, always smiling and with such a sweet voice... tall and graceful, she had a presence about her. Working with her was always a pleasant experience.”  \n",

       "      <td>Nationalism of one kind or another was the cause of most of the genocide of the twentieth century. Flags are bits of coloured cloth that governments use first to shrink-wrap people's minds and then as ceremonial shrouds to bury the dead.” None other than Man Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy said this during a speech in 2002, triggering a controversy, expectedly. While most are likely to dismiss the writer’s view as an extreme one, though thought-provoking, the usual lament is that the spirit of nationalism is generally on the wane. A case in point is the controversy surrounding the national anthem, which was made mandatory in movie theatres but after objections were raised, the rule was relaxed.This Republic Day, we pose the question to prominent personalities from different walks of life – Is nationalism dead or more alive than ever?Nationalism has its inherent dangers:C Radhakrishnan, writerNationalism is a natural feeling. It has been with us ever since we evolved into community living. At the same time, we always wanted to expand our domain either by befriending or by conquering other communities. It has therefore been a conflicting concept. The conflict has been between remaining where you were and expanding your territory.For survival, this emotion played a big role. But the desire, when associated with narrow feelings of caste or religion, works against the very survival.Nationalism has always been a feeling stemming from identities such as caste and religion. So there is always a danger of it acting as a divisive factor internally and also result in us becoming irrationally selective when it comes to external relations. I am afraid both the dangers are present in Indian nationalism today. It may prevent us from being peaceful at home and getting into associations with others in the world dispassionately.Youngsters are more selfless in giving back to the society: Vijayaraghavan, technocratAmong the young generation, the spirit of nationalism is on the increase, in my opinion. Just look at the number of national flags on vehicles on Independence Day or Republic Day. It is much higher than, say, 15 years ago. True, there was some resistance to the national anthem being played in movie theatres but it is a very small minority that harbours such extreme views. Ninety five per cent or more will happily stand up while the anthem is being played and will even be ready to sing along.If you consider the aspect of giving something back to the society, here again, the younger generation scores over their parents. The earlier generation would donate to temples, churches or mosques, even to political parties, but they were not so keen to contribute to a cause or charity. The younger generation, especially the IT crowd whom I am familiar with, does more by donating or even working as volunteers. These people have contempt for politicians but the main difference is that they contribute without expecting anything in return. The earlier generation who used to be part of service organisations would pool in money to donate to the less privileged but would organise a function so that they get some publicity.The concept of patriotism has changed for the new gen professionals who would have no problem working along with a Pakistani in a foreign country because they believe that all people are good, only the netas are not. It is in the interest of the leaders to keep the problem simmering in Kashmir, so that they can mobilise people against the ‘enemy’.Indians don’t have a long history of nationalism: Sreekumaran Thampi, poetAs a society, we have never had a strong sense of nationalism. We were a group of warring kings who came together only because of the British. But in France, for example, they have a long history of nationalism and even today, they hate any language other than French being used there. But we are too diverse in India and were never united, originally.For the present generation, it’s all about the world rather than about India, because the world has become smaller for them, owing to the internet. They have no interest in learning about the freedom struggle either and this is reflected in our poetry and songs. I have published a book of my patriotic poems in the past but no one wants that anymore. It’s probably because such poems, songs and films have a message; the youngsters don’t like to be told anything today, they think they know everything.Embrace the many Indias within our country: Murali Gopy, actor, writerI believe India is a union of many identities, belief systems and ethnicities. It cannot have a single nationality; instead it should be a combination of many. So, a feeling of togetherness should be brought in, without hurting the feelings of any. What we see now is that there is a strong urge to impose the idea of a singular nationality. There is a hard line right wing effort to codify nationalism into a feeling that there is only a singular stream of national feeling with absolutely no pluralities. I don’t think it will work here, simply because it is not the truth about India. We have to redefine the idea of nationalism to develop our own brand of a confederation of identities. The idea of ‘One India’ is actually about understanding and embracing the many Indias that exist within our society. It’s time we redefined and reinvented the age old motto of ‘Unity in Diversity’.You start loving your country when you go abroad: Lekshmy Rajeev, writerI feel the importance of being an Indian when I go abroad. That is when we long to come back home, to our land. Our country is the most beautiful of all, rich in values. But within our country, there is division, between North Indians and South Indians, which goes against nationalism.Every time I hear the national anthem, I get goose bumps. I don’t mind reciting it aloud and stand up wherever I am, be in theatres or in any other event. I don’t think nationalism is diminishing in our society. We can’t expect a teenage girl to be nationalistic but it grows with age, along with your level of maturity and understanding. As you mingle with other cultures or with people from other nations, you understand what is nationalism.Set the national flag free: Major Ravi, filmmakerII believe everyone has that patriotic spirit and the youth must grow up with it regardless of their caste, religion or language. Nationalism loses its spark only when you politicise it. Take for instance, the national anthem being played in theatres or film festivals. I have observed that there are always a few who don’t stand up, just to show their protest. But why give them a reason to revolt by forcing such rules on people? If you pass an order making the National Anthem mandatory, it must also be implemented properly; else you are just mindlessly playing with an important aspect of the country. Ultimately, a theatre is a venue for entertainment; let it stay that way.When I went to the US, I was amazed by what I saw. Every house has a national flag. In India, to hoist our flag, there are so many laws – it has be raised before sunrise and brought down before sunset. I think the flag should be set free; allow people to carry the flag around proudly and say aloud that they are Indians.If you look at Bollywood, there are at least two movies about national integration being released. But in Malayalam, till Keerthichakra was released, people weren’t bothered much about what was happening in the border or what the soldiers were going through for the country. When films showing the firing at Kashmir or the insurgency at Assam border come out, it automatically makes people love their country more. However, in our film industry, once you start making such films they start bracketing you as an army director or a war-film director. Most filmmakers don’t want to venture into that territory for fear of that. I am a strong believer that such a segment of filmmakers should exist. In my films, I don’t make the protagonist say Bharat Mata Ki Jai; but that’s the sentiment evoked in the audience through scenes showing the soldiers’ bravery. I believe cinema has to be used positively to kindle patriotic feelings.</td>\n",

       "      <td>By Adnaan RizviAbhinav Bindra, the first Indian shooter to win an individual gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, in the 10 m Air Rifle event, was recently in the city for a private event. Talking about Lucknow, Bindra said, \"I have been to the city a few times but haven’t had the time to see much of it. But yes, the feel that one gets here is of warmth and welcome.\"With leagues becoming popular in sports like the cricket, kabaddi, hockey and badminton league, we asked Bindra if a league is also possible in shooting and he doesn’t rule out the possibility. \"Shooting league is something that has to be driven by the federation. It will give shooting a platform and will take it to households to achieve great heights. A lot of positives will also come up for the sport as well as for the athletes as it will give them a platform for more competition and perform to polish their skills,\" said Bindra.Now a retired shooter, Bindra had recently said in an interview that India should bid to host the Olympic Games as it will boost talent. \"It is a matter of priority to host Olympics after all. Channelizing investment in hosting the Olympic Games is great, but I don’t feel it is feasible because there is only so much money that we can put into sports. It is not about the positive or negative use of the money; it is all about what your priority is,\" says Bindra. Adding his personal point of view, he shared, \"Personally, my priority will rather be to channelize funding in actually developing the young grassroots athlete so that they can be given a platform and opportunity to do well in Olympic Games.\"Soon the shooter's life will be seen on the big screen with actor Harshvardhan Kapoor playing him on screen and Anil Kapoor playing Abhinav's father. Speaking about the same, Abhinav said, \"I wrote my autobiography, which got published in 2011 and its rights were also sold several years ago. Now finally, the movie makes have planned to adapt that story into a film. Harshvardhan Kapoor will be essaying my role and I think he fits my character perfectly.\" While Milkha Singh and Mahavir Singh Phogat made headlines for their biopic at a very late age, one on Abhinav is being made when the sporstman is just 35-years old. Ask him if he feels it's too early for a biopic to be made on him and Abhinav said, \"There was a biopic made on Mary Kom too who is almost the same age as me. So, it is not in my hands that a biopic is being made on me. I wrote a book a few years back and that’s being adapted on screen. So that's how it all happened.\"</td>\n",

       "0  Nationalism of one kind or another was the cause of most of the genocide of the twentieth century. Flags are bits of coloured cloth that governments use first to shrink-wrap people's minds and then as ceremonial shrouds to bury the dead.” None other than Man Booker Prize winner Arundhati Roy said this during a speech in 2002, triggering a controversy, expectedly. While most are likely to dismiss the writer’s view as an extreme one, though thought-provoking, the usual lament is that the spirit of nationalism is generally on the wane. A case in point is the controversy surrounding the national anthem, which was made mandatory in movie theatres but after objections were raised, the rule was relaxed.This Republic Day, we pose the question to prominent personalities from different walks of life – Is nationalism dead or more alive than ever?Nationalism has its inherent dangers:C Radhakrishnan, writerNationalism is a natural feeling. It has been with us ever since we evolved into community living. At the same time, we always wanted to expand our domain either by befriending or by conquering other communities. It has therefore been a conflicting concept. The conflict has been between remaining where you were and expanding your territory.For survival, this emotion played a big role. But the desire, when associated with narrow feelings of caste or religion, works against the very survival.Nationalism has always been a feeling stemming from identities such as caste and religion. So there is always a danger of it acting as a divisive factor internally and also result in us becoming irrationally selective when it comes to external relations. I am afraid both the dangers are present in Indian nationalism today. It may prevent us from being peaceful at home and getting into associations with others in the world dispassionately.Youngsters are more selfless in giving back to the society: Vijayaraghavan, technocratAmong the young generation, the spirit of nationalism is on the increase, in my opinion. Just look at the number of national flags on vehicles on Independence Day or Republic Day. It is much higher than, say, 15 years ago. True, there was some resistance to the national anthem being played in movie theatres but it is a very small minority that harbours such extreme views. Ninety five per cent or more will happily stand up while the anthem is being played and will even be ready to sing along.If you consider the aspect of giving something back to the society, here again, the younger generation scores over their parents. The earlier generation would donate to temples, churches or mosques, even to political parties, but they were not so keen to contribute to a cause or charity. The younger generation, especially the IT crowd whom I am familiar with, does more by donating or even working as volunteers. These people have contempt for politicians but the main difference is that they contribute without expecting anything in return. The earlier generation who used to be part of service organisations would pool in money to donate to the less privileged but would organise a function so that they get some publicity.The concept of patriotism has changed for the new gen professionals who would have no problem working along with a Pakistani in a foreign country because they believe that all people are good, only the netas are not. It is in the interest of the leaders to keep the problem simmering in Kashmir, so that they can mobilise people against the ‘enemy’.Indians don’t have a long history of nationalism: Sreekumaran Thampi, poetAs a society, we have never had a strong sense of nationalism. We were a group of warring kings who came together only because of the British. But in France, for example, they have a long history of nationalism and even today, they hate any language other than French being used there. But we are too diverse in India and were never united, originally.For the present generation, it’s all about the world rather than about India, because the world has become smaller for them, owing to the internet. They have no interest in learning about the freedom struggle either and this is reflected in our poetry and songs. I have published a book of my patriotic poems in the past but no one wants that anymore. It’s probably because such poems, songs and films have a message; the youngsters don’t like to be told anything today, they think they know everything.Embrace the many Indias within our country: Murali Gopy, actor, writerI believe India is a union of many identities, belief systems and ethnicities. It cannot have a single nationality; instead it should be a combination of many. So, a feeling of togetherness should be brought in, without hurting the feelings of any. What we see now is that there is a strong urge to impose the idea of a singular nationality. There is a hard line right wing effort to codify nationalism into a feeling that there is only a singular stream of national feeling with absolutely no pluralities. I don’t think it will work here, simply because it is not the truth about India. We have to redefine the idea of nationalism to develop our own brand of a confederation of identities. The idea of ‘One India’ is actually about understanding and embracing the many Indias that exist within our society. It’s time we redefined and reinvented the age old motto of ‘Unity in Diversity’.You start loving your country when you go abroad: Lekshmy Rajeev, writerI feel the importance of being an Indian when I go abroad. That is when we long to come back home, to our land. Our country is the most beautiful of all, rich in values. But within our country, there is division, between North Indians and South Indians, which goes against nationalism.Every time I hear the national anthem, I get goose bumps. I don’t mind reciting it aloud and stand up wherever I am, be in theatres or in any other event. I don’t think nationalism is diminishing in our society. We can’t expect a teenage girl to be nationalistic but it grows with age, along with your level of maturity and understanding. As you mingle with other cultures or with people from other nations, you understand what is nationalism.Set the national flag free: Major Ravi, filmmakerII believe everyone has that patriotic spirit and the youth must grow up with it regardless of their caste, religion or language. Nationalism loses its spark only when you politicise it. Take for instance, the national anthem being played in theatres or film festivals. I have observed that there are always a few who don’t stand up, just to show their protest. But why give them a reason to revolt by forcing such rules on people? If you pass an order making the National Anthem mandatory, it must also be implemented properly; else you are just mindlessly playing with an important aspect of the country. Ultimately, a theatre is a venue for entertainment; let it stay that way.When I went to the US, I was amazed by what I saw. Every house has a national flag. In India, to hoist our flag, there are so many laws – it has be raised before sunrise and brought down before sunset. I think the flag should be set free; allow people to carry the flag around proudly and say aloud that they are Indians.If you look at Bollywood, there are at least two movies about national integration being released. But in Malayalam, till Keerthichakra was released, people weren’t bothered much about what was happening in the border or what the soldiers were going through for the country. When films showing the firing at Kashmir or the insurgency at Assam border come out, it automatically makes people love their country more. However, in our film industry, once you start making such films they start bracketing you as an army director or a war-film director. Most filmmakers don’t want to venture into that territory for fear of that. I am a strong believer that such a segment of filmmakers should exist. In my films, I don’t make the protagonist say Bharat Mata Ki Jai; but that’s the sentiment evoked in the audience through scenes showing the soldiers’ bravery. I believe cinema has to be used positively to kindle patriotic feelings.  \n",

RizviAbhinav Bindra, the first Indian shooter to win an individual gold medal at the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games, in the 10 m Air Rifle event, was recently in the city for a private event. Talking about Lucknow, Bindra said, \"I have been to the city a few times but haven’t had the time to see much of it. But yes, the feel that one gets here is of warmth and welcome.\"With leagues becoming popular in sports like the cricket, kabaddi, hockey and badminton league, we asked Bindra if a league is also possible in shooting and he doesn’t rule out the possibility. \"Shooting league is something that has to be driven by the federation. It will give shooting a platform and will take it to households to achieve great heights. A lot of positives will also come up for the sport as well as for the athletes as it will give them a platform for more competition and perform to polish their skills,\" said Bindra.Now a retired shooter, Bindra had recently said in an interview that India should bid to host the Olympic Games as it will boost talent. \"It is a matter of priority to host Olympics after all. Channelizing investment in hosting the Olympic Games is great, but I don’t feel it is feasible because there is only so much money that we can put into sports. It is not about the positive or negative use of the money; it is all about what your priority is,\" says Bindra. Adding his personal point of view, he shared, \"Personally, my priority will rather be to channelize funding in actually developing the young grassroots athlete so that they can be given a platform and opportunity to do well in Olympic Games.\"Soon the shooter's life will be seen on the big screen with actor Harshvardhan Kapoor playing him on screen and Anil Kapoor playing Abhinav's father. Speaking about the same, Abhinav said, \"I wrote my autobiography, which got published in 2011 and its rights were also sold several years ago. Now finally, the movie makes have planned to adapt that story into a film. Harshvardhan Kapoor will be essaying my role and I think he fits my character perfectly.\" While Milkha Singh and Mahavir Singh Phogat made headlines for their biopic at a very late age, one on Abhinav is being made when the sporstman is just 35-years old. Ask him if he feels it's too early for a biopic to be made on him and Abhinav said, \"There was a biopic made on Mary Kom too who is almost the same age as me. So, it is not in my hands that a biopic is being made on me. I wrote a book a few years back and that’s being adapted on screen. So that's how it all happened.\"  "

But what’s even more amusing is his new tie-up with the Baba of Stretches — Baba Ramdev. Dadha’s company, which also deals with Viagra, is now retailing Baba Ramdev’s ‘magic potions’ of health and vitality.Batting for romance!Sources say that pampered princess Rayane, the well-brought up daughter of Radikaa and Sarath kumar, is an expert at planning romantic surprises for her cricketer husband Mithun. From Eiffel Tower dates to candle-lit dinners by the Thames, this recently married girl pulls out every stop to capture that perfect smile of her husband, who is soft spoken and otherwise camera-shy. Sources say that the two, who even work out together, are planning their next big adventure.What’s it about these men?Why can’t some women just keep their hands and glances to themselves? Last heard, these two hunky hoteliers are the gush-topic at every girly do. Vikram Cotah and Vijai Singh are two men who know their appeal and often play to the galleries, too. Pretending not to notice, yet soaking in all the admiration is what makes them sexier. At a recent fashion show where Vikram was modelling, his tongue-out pose had many a woman faint and they had to be revived with a shot of tequila!This playboy takes the crown!This hotelier, who is known for his undying desire for society babes, it seems also ends each of his dates on a terrible note to avoid any emotional baggage. We hear that the man, who woos his women with designer bags, perfumes and even jewellery, picks a fight at the end of the romantic weekend or week, depending on how long the woman can keep his attention. Married to a soft-spoken lady who lives with him in a joint family, this roving-eyed romantic kills it all with a drunken fight or planned attempt to ensure his fling never calls him again. He goes back home to a peaceful sleep, knowing he’s had his share of horizontal partying and the party has well and truly ended.Beware of BagvatiThis 4ft-something socialite, known for her excessive partying ways and self-inviting herself to the big dos around town, has earned a new tag. Folks have started enquiring if Bagvati is also invited. And if she is, they are avoiding the event totally. It seems she requests for lipstick or some cosmetic from unsuspecting women in loos and in dimly lit events and in a slick way, steals money or something valuable. Last heard, some event managers are thinking of completely striking her off their guest list because in any case, this lady doesn’t just gate crash, but also brings her plus-one.Burma Bazaar BeautiesDo you know that there are these three inimitable socialites, thanks to their patchy makeup and over-the-top phone accessories, who always make a statement? It seems they regularly prance around Burma Bazaar’s many phone shops to buy their ‘designer’ phone cases.Certainly no cool cat,thisIt seems a leading spa chain, headed by a dynamic lady, is considering legal action against a client who harasses its staff with delayed appointments and often picking up fights to keep the salon open till very late. And the best part is, she always pretends to be unhappy with the service when the time comes to pay up. It seems this mouthy lady,who’s been thrown out of every kitty club in town, and known for her controversies more than the ‘social’ work she does, isn’t worried as this has been her way of life for over seven years.(Views expressed above are the author’s own)Tongue In Check by Apsara Reddy - Writer, activist, anchor</td>\n",

       "      <td>When she signed up for director Guru Deshpande’s mystery thriller, Samhaara, Kavya Shetty had absolutely no apprehensions about the fact that it also starred Hariprriya in the lead, along with Chiranjeevi Sarja. “For starters, both of us have almost the same screen space in the film, even though we have only one scene together. But more importantly, the characterization for each of us is completely different. Hariprriya plays a character with negative shades, while I essay the role of the fun-loving Janaki, who is Chiru’s childhood pal, and eventual love interest. Janaki is a TV journalist and while that aspect of her is not explored in detail, she is instrumental in helping Chiru’s character solve the mystery in the tale. I also liked the look of the character,” explains Kavya. Samhaara is the actress’ first film with the actor, which she says was a lot of fun. But she also sympathized with Chiru, who often had to work double shifts. “This was one of the most organized sets that I have been on. While I was on call during the day for my scenes with Chiru and could then leave, he had to stay back and shoot his portions with Hariprriya. The thriller was shot across Mysuru, Bengaluru and Mangaluru, with major portions in the coastal city. We were there in May, and while I am from Mangaluru, I found it crazily hot at the time. And to top it, my character had to do a lot of running or driving around town, so I was out in that heat,” says Kavya.The film also got her to work with Chikkanna yet again. “If Chikkanna is in a film, there are bound to be a few laughs. He plays a cop, who comes across as a serious police officer, but whatever he says and does is funny. He had the rest of us cracking up on set all the time,” she says.</td>\n",

       "      <td>On the eve of the 69th Republic Day on Thursday, Karnataka had much to cheer when the list of civilian honour winners had nine from the state, with Bengaluru boy and cue sport champion Pankaj Advani named one of the recipients of the Padma Bhushan for 2018. There was jubilation in the Advani household and it took us a while to catch hold of the man of the moment for a quick chat, as he answered call after call from people congratulating him on the honour. “Receiving a civilian award is recognition of the highest order and I’m honoured and humbled, not only for myself, personally, but also as it is recognition for the snooker fraternity. I am glad that it has come ‘our’ way,” says Pankaj, adding that he is looking forward to the actual award ceremony. “I have been to one function, when I won a Padma Shri in 2009. I look forward to reliving those memories and creating even better ones this time, considering that two of my good friends, MS Dhoni and Somdev Devvarman, will also be there,” he says.The award, says Pankaj, couldn’t have come at a better time. “I won pretty much most of the events that I participated in last year. But, more importantly, the Padma Bhushan has come at a time when I am the reigning World Billiards and Snooker champion. I ended 2017 with a bang and began 2018 by being conferred the third highest civilian honour from the Government of India; it’s an exciting start,” he says. So, is he now eyeing a higher order on the award list? “You have to wait a long time to get these awards and the government has a tough job of selecting who deserves it for that year and figuring out who can wait a turn. It all depends on how people perceive your achievements,” Pankaj signs off.</td>\n",

       "0  Far too fancyPradeep Dadha, known as the big daddy of the pharma business, is far too fancy in the way that he entertains; flies the high skies in his private jet and hosts exquisite masquerade parties. But what’s even more amusing is his new tie-up with the Baba of Stretches — Baba Ramdev. Dadha’s company, which also deals with Viagra, is now retailing Baba Ramdev’s ‘magic potions’ of health and vitality.Batting for romance!Sources say that pampered princess Rayane, the well-brought up daughter of Radikaa and Sarath kumar, is an expert at planning romantic surprises for her cricketer husband Mithun. From Eiffel Tower dates to candle-lit dinners by the Thames, this recently married girl pulls out every stop to capture that perfect smile of her husband, who is soft spoken and otherwise camera-shy. Sources say that the two, who even work out together, are planning their next big adventure.What’s it about these men?Why can’t some women just keep their hands and glances to themselves? Last heard, these two hunky hoteliers are the gush-topic at every girly do. Vikram Cotah and Vijai Singh are two men who know their appeal and often play to the galleries, too. Pretending not to notice, yet soaking in all the admiration is what makes them sexier. At a recent fashion show where Vikram was modelling, his tongue-out pose had many a woman faint and they had to be revived with a shot of tequila!This playboy takes the crown!This hotelier, who is known for his undying desire for society babes, it seems also ends each of his dates on a terrible note to avoid any emotional baggage. We hear that the man, who woos his women with designer bags, perfumes and even jewellery, picks a fight at the end of the romantic weekend or week, depending on how long the woman can keep his attention. Married to a soft-spoken lady who lives with him in a joint family, this roving-eyed romantic kills it all with a drunken fight or planned attempt to ensure his fling never calls him again. He goes back home to a peaceful sleep, knowing he’s had his share of horizontal partying and the party has well and truly ended.Beware of BagvatiThis 4ft-something socialite, known for her excessive partying ways and self-inviting herself to the big dos around town, has earned a new tag. Folks have started enquiring if Bagvati is also invited. And if she is, they are avoiding the event totally. It seems she requests for lipstick or some cosmetic from unsuspecting women in loos and in dimly lit events and in a slick way, steals money or something valuable. Last heard, some event managers are thinking of completely striking her off their guest list because in any case, this lady doesn’t just gate crash, but also brings her plus-one.Burma Bazaar BeautiesDo you know that there are these three inimitable socialites, thanks to their patchy makeup and over-the-top phone accessories, who always make a statement? It seems they regularly prance around Burma Bazaar’s many phone shops to buy their ‘designer’ phone cases.Certainly no cool cat,thisIt seems a leading spa chain, headed by a dynamic lady, is considering legal action against a client who harasses its staff with delayed appointments and often picking up fights to keep the salon open till very late. And the best part is, she always pretends to be unhappy with the service when the time comes to pay up. It seems this mouthy lady,who’s been thrown out of every kitty club in town, and known for her controversies more than the ‘social’ work she does, isn’t worried as this has been her way of life for over seven years.(Views expressed above are the author’s own)Tongue In Check by Apsara Reddy - Writer, activist, anchor  \n",

But more importantly, the characterization for each of us is completely different. Hariprriya plays a character with negative shades, while I essay the role of the fun-loving Janaki, who is Chiru’s childhood pal, and eventual love interest. Janaki is a TV journalist and while that aspect of her is not explored in detail, she is instrumental in helping Chiru’s character solve the mystery in the tale. I also liked the look of the character,” explains Kavya. Samhaara is the actress’ first film with the actor, which she says was a lot of fun. But she also sympathized with Chiru, who often had to work double shifts. “This was one of the most organized sets that I have been on. While I was on call during the day for my scenes with Chiru and could then leave, he had to stay back and shoot his portions with Hariprriya. The thriller was shot across Mysuru, Bengaluru and Mangaluru, with major portions in the coastal city. We were there in May, and while I am from Mangaluru, I found it crazily hot at the time. And to top it, my character had to do a lot of running or driving around town, so I was out in that heat,” says Kavya.The film also got her to work with Chikkanna yet again. “If Chikkanna is in a film, there are bound to be a few laughs. He plays a cop, who comes across as a serious police officer, but whatever he says and does is funny. He had the rest of us cracking up on set all the time,” she says.  \n",

There was jubilation in the Advani household and it took us a while to catch hold of the man of the moment for a quick chat, as he answered call after call from people congratulating him on the honour. “Receiving a civilian award is recognition of the highest order and I’m honoured and humbled, not only for myself, personally, but also as it is recognition for the snooker fraternity. I am glad that it has come ‘our’ way,” says Pankaj, adding that he is looking forward to the actual award ceremony. “I have been to one function, when I won a Padma Shri in 2009. I look forward to reliving those memories and creating even better ones this time, considering that two of my good friends, MS Dhoni and Somdev Devvarman, will also be there,” he says.The award, says Pankaj, couldn’t have come at a better time. “I won pretty much most of the events that I participated in last year. But, more importantly, the Padma Bhushan has come at a time when I am the reigning World Billiards and Snooker champion. I ended 2017 with a bang and began 2018 by being conferred the third highest civilian honour from the Government of India; it’s an exciting start,” he says. So, is he now eyeing a higher order on the award list? “You have to wait a long time to get these awards and the government has a tough job of selecting who deserves it for that year and figuring out who can wait a turn. It all depends on how people perceive your achievements,” Pankaj signs off.  "

       "      <td>By Prachi AryaLucknowite Satyam Sahai recently made the city proud after participating in Iron Man Triathlon 2017 in Western Australia. The Iron Man is a series of long distance triathlon consisting of 3.8 km of swimming, 180.25 km of bicycle riding and 42.20 km of running to be completed without break in 13 hours, 18 minutes. Sahai has become the third UPite to complete this challenge and get the title of Iron Man.However, it hasn't been an easy task for Sahai to complete the challenge. \"First of all, these events are not about competing, these are all about endurance. The events happen one after the other and one is awake almost the whole day. So, 14 to 16 hours of endurance requires a lot of stamina and you have to be adept at swimming, cycling and running to complete the challenge in the stipulated time. So, in order to qualify in all the events, you need to be well versed with all three forms, which requires a lot of physical training,\" says he, adding, \"To be honest, I had no training for the challenge. Whatever I did or learnt was from the training which I took from videos online. I used to watch them and learn the basic fitness techniques to increase my endurance level for Iron Man.\"An educationist by profession, Sahai says that sports has always been his hobby. \"Sports was always my hobby and passion. I just love to do it in my free time. I get an adrenal rush when I enter the ground. I ran for 21 kms in Lucknow Marathon with a knee injury and a ligament rupture.\" It was this penchant for fitness and sports that made him enroll for the Iron Man.The educationist feels that one needs to be focused and determined to strike their goals. \"Discipline should be the priority. You have 24 hours with you. The way you utilise them is your talent,\" says the Iron Man, adding, \"There’s always time to follow your dreams and work towards fulfilling them.\"</td>\n",

The evening turned out to be both nostalgic and fun filled. Some of the students, who met each other after nearly 25 years, had a lot to catch up on. Sapna Surekha, who came from Kolkata and was meeting some of her classmates after a long time, said, \"We are all connected on FB, but meeting them in person is a different experience all together.\" While Rajat Monga, who came from the US, was spotted reminiscing the pranks that were played during school days. \"Once the entire class was punished when one of the students had burst a fire cracker in the school premises. School days were real great fun,\" he recalled. What also made the evening an engaging affair was the presence of DJ Tarun, who came from Delhi. He belted out all the party numbers like Ladki Beautiful, Sara Zamaana, Haseeno Ka Deewana that was enjoyed by the guests to the hilt.Shweta and Tanay Srivastav (R) Ferzana Rana (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)Anuradha Mathur (R) Sapna Surekha, Col Saurabh and Nidhi Modi (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)Vinay and Rohit (R) Vineeta Katiyar and Vandana Keshri (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)Anuradha Mathur &amp; Anurag Narayan (R) DJ Tarun (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)</td>\n",

       "      <td>Think of Makarand Deshpande and his signature locks and moustache immediately come to mind. And that is exactly what the versatile actor had to do away with for his role in Buckaasuura. If you’ve watched the teaser of the film, there’s a good chance that you had to watch it a second or third time to recognize Makarand in it. We ask him about his transformation and more…How much work went into your look for Buckaasuura?I had to completely change my look, by doing away with my signature moustache and hair. To do that, I had to first become neutral, since I had to not just look like a person who is troublesome, but also someone who is educated and smart. That was the most difficult part. But the director, Navneeth (Kumar), had a clear idea about my look, so that helped.Did you have any apprehensions about the look? I was actually very excited when I learnt that the makers wanted me to essay such a character, and about the looks as well. We did some look tests, to figure out the right kind or beard and glasses, etc. Sometimes, there are small details that go into shaping a character that you may not think are important, but they are significant.One needs to keep their body language in check while playing a criminal mastermind who is highly educated. Was there something constantly playing on your mind during the shoot?Yes, all the time. My character needed to be hypnotic — people with knowledge mange to cast a hypnotic spell on others. And that’s what I had to keep in mind. The character is someone who is possessed by his own knowledge and ideologies, regardless of them being right or wrong. There is conviction in whatever he says and does. So, I had to keep all that in mind.What was your experience of having worked with a young team in this film?Because they were young, they were ready to experiment. And despite being young, they knew the dramatic components of the story very well. They knew their movie well, which made it a good experience. It has been the coolest shoot that I have been on. I had no issues whatsoever.That’s high praise coming from you…That’s the thing about Kannada films. Be it Dandupalya or this movie, or any of the Kannada films I’ve worked in, with whatever budget they have, they manage to spend extra money to cast an actor from Mumbai. That says a lot about their conviction and passion for their films — that come what may, they want the best. And within the limited budget, they even get details, such as the look of a character, right. That is why it is great to act in Kannada films.What else do we have to look forward to from you in Sandalwood?Dandupalya 3 is in the making and there is also the Kannada remake of the Malayalam hit Two Countries. I am really looking forward to these films.</td>\n",

The Iron Man is a series of long distance triathlon consisting of 3.8 km of swimming, 180.25 km of bicycle riding and 42.20 km of running to be completed without break in 13 hours, 18 minutes. Sahai has become the third UPite to complete this challenge and get the title of Iron Man.However, it hasn't been an easy task for Sahai to complete the challenge. \"First of all, these events are not about competing, these are all about endurance. The events happen one after the other and one is awake almost the whole day. So, 14 to 16 hours of endurance requires a lot of stamina and you have to be adept at swimming, cycling and running to complete the challenge in the stipulated time. So, in order to qualify in all the events, you need to be well versed with all three forms, which requires a lot of physical training,\" says he, adding, \"To be honest, I had no training for the challenge. Whatever I did or learnt was from the training which I took from videos online. I used to watch them and learn the basic fitness techniques to increase my endurance level for Iron Man.\"An educationist by profession, Sahai says that sports has always been his hobby. \"Sports was always my hobby and passion. I just love to do it in my free time. I get an adrenal rush when I enter the ground. I ran for 21 kms in Lucknow Marathon with a knee injury and a ligament rupture.\" It was this penchant for fitness and sports that made him enroll for the Iron Man.The educationist feels that one needs to be focused and determined to strike their goals. \"Discipline should be the priority. You have 24 hours with you. The way you utilise them is your talent,\" says the Iron Man, adding, \"There’s always time to follow your dreams and work towards fulfilling them.\"  \n",

The evening turned out to be both nostalgic and fun filled. Some of the students, who met each other after nearly 25 years, had a lot to catch up on. Sapna Surekha, who came from Kolkata and was meeting some of her classmates after a long time, said, \"We are all connected on FB, but meeting them in person is a different experience all together.\" While Rajat Monga, who came from the US, was spotted reminiscing the pranks that were played during school days. \"Once the entire class was punished when one of the students had burst a fire cracker in the school premises. School days were real great fun,\" he recalled. What also made the evening an engaging affair was the presence of DJ Tarun, who came from Delhi. He belted out all the party numbers like Ladki Beautiful, Sara Zamaana, Haseeno Ka Deewana that was enjoyed by the guests to the hilt.Shweta and Tanay Srivastav (R) Ferzana Rana (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)Anuradha Mathur (R) Sapna Surekha, Col Saurabh and Nidhi Modi (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)Vinay and Rohit (R) Vineeta Katiyar and Vandana Keshri (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)Anuradha Mathur & Anurag Narayan (R) DJ Tarun (BCCL/ Unmesh Pandey)  \n",

       "4  Think of Makarand Deshpande and his signature locks and moustache immediately come to mind. And that is exactly what the versatile actor had to do away with for his role in Buckaasuura. If you’ve watched the teaser of the film, there’s a good chance that you had to watch it a second or third time to recognize Makarand in it. We ask him about his transformation and more…How much work went into your look for Buckaasuura?I had to completely change my look, by doing away with my signature moustache and hair. To do that, I had to first become neutral, since I had to not just look like a person who is troublesome, but also someone who is educated and smart. That was the most difficult part. But the director, Navneeth (Kumar), had a clear idea about my look, so that helped.Did you have any apprehensions about the look? I was actually very excited when I learnt that the makers wanted me to essay such a character, and about the looks as well. We did some look tests, to figure out the right kind or beard and glasses, etc. Sometimes, there are small details that go into shaping a character that you may not think are important, but they are significant.One needs to keep their body language in check while playing a criminal mastermind who is highly educated. Was there something constantly playing on your mind during the shoot?Yes, all the time. My character needed to be hypnotic — people with knowledge mange to cast a hypnotic spell on others. And that’s what I had to keep in mind. The character is someone who is possessed by his own knowledge and ideologies, regardless of them being right or wrong. There is conviction in whatever he says and does. So, I had to keep all that in mind.What was your experience of having worked with a young team in this film?Because they were young, they were ready to experiment. And despite being young, they knew the dramatic components of the story very well. They knew their movie well, which made it a good experience. It has been the coolest shoot that I have been on. I had no issues whatsoever.That’s high praise coming from you…That’s the thing about Kannada films. Be it Dandupalya or this movie, or any of the Kannada films I’ve worked in, with whatever budget they have, they manage to spend extra money to cast an actor from Mumbai. That says a lot about their conviction and passion for their films — that come what may, they want the best. And within the limited budget, they even get details, such as the look of a character, right. That is why it is great to act in Kannada films.What else do we have to look forward to from you in Sandalwood?Dandupalya 3 is in the making and there is also the Kannada remake of the Malayalam hit Two Countries. I am really looking forward to these films.  "

       "      <td>NEW DELHI: With the Gujarat poll verdict indicating farm distress had put the ruling BJP on a weak wicket in rural areas, the government’s next budget is likely to be more farmers’ centric focussing on getting them remunerative prices through market reforms and supporting them through robust credit facilities and by increasing the crop insurance footprint.Agrarian crisis will be one of the key issues in the run up to the assembly polls in Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan and the general election and thus Budget 2018 will provide the government an opportunity to announce its intent.“We had a good crop year in 2016-17, but farmers had to face problem in getting remunerative prices of their produce. This is something which we need to address and the budget is likely to focus on this aspect”, said a senior official who has been part of a team to extend agriculture ministry’s input for budget to the finance ministry.The Centre has already taken several measures to address the issue but will now attempt to strengthen it by taking actions like devising more systematic procurement method and expanding the network of e-NAM (e-National Agriculture Market) from 585 in 2018 to over 1,000 by 2020. The idea will be to bring more and more regulated market on e-NAM platform so that the farmers can get better price of their produce without being exploited by commission agents and cartel of traders.“The NITI Aayog and the Prime Minister’s economic advisory council too are working on it. Though agriculture is the subject where the states have to be on board for success of many schemes, the government’s focus in the budget is likely to be on allocating more fund for centrally-sponsored schemes”, said the official.The funds for expanding e-NAM’s footprints, cold chain, irrigation infrastructure, micro-irrigation and crop insurance scheme are expected to be increased.“Farmers need input subsidies and minimum support price (MSP) for their produce, but these two alone cannot solve the problem”, said the official while emphasising on the need to create robust market mechanisms for farm produce so that farmers don’t face a crisis in a good crop year like what the rural Gujarat faced.The crop year 2016-17 (July-June) had seen record foodgrain production of 275.68 million tonnes. Besides, more farmers came under the network of the new crop insurance. Number of farmers, benefiting from crop insurance also increased in 2016-17 as compared to 2015-16.All these, however, do not seem to have addressed the problems. Horticulture production also reached record levels, but did not prove to be a boon for farmers. There have been report of distress selling from many states.“These are the worrying signs. Loss due to disaster can be tackled through insurance. But the problem of plenty (bumper production) can only be tackled through robust market system, cold chain and effective procurement mechanism. The 2018-19 budget is likely to address these issues”, said the official.Farmers in Saurashtra-Kutch region, where the BJP’s tally went down as compared to 2012, saw prices of cotton and groundnut produce slide. Though the Centre had increased MSP and the state had extended bonus on it, poor procurement had forced farmers to go for distress sales in open markets that fetched them much lower price than the MSP.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Tollywood actress Prerna Khanna, who is all set to make her debut in Kollywood, currently has three projects in her kitty. While Verenna Vendum and Beep, directed by Shivabharathi Kumaran and Shanmuga Sundar respectively, are in its post-production stage, Ucham, which has her paired opposite Balakrishna Kola, has completed its second schedule.Prerna says, “I play a Tamil girl in Verenna Vendum, which is set against a village backdrop. The film is about a couple whose relationship flourishes online. Beep has me in the role of an NRI who comes back home, and her life changes with an event — it is a mystery thriller.”The actress adds, “In Ucham, I will be seen as a Punjabi girl, a software employee who loves Chennai more than Mumbai.”Prerna, who forayed into filmdom with the Tollywood multi-starrer flick Rama Rama Krishna Krishna a few years ago, took a sabbatical to pursue higher studies. “I wanted to complete my education and it was the right time for me to do it. I had several offers while I was studying, and even I was keen to do films. I’m quite excited about all the three films that I’ve signed and I’m eagerly looking forward to the projects which came to me simultaneously,” she says with a smile.</td>\n",

       "      <td>From his debut show Butterflies aired on Asianet Plus to Flowers TV’s popular programme Comedy Utsavam, Mithun Ramesh has come a long way in the television industry.Apart from anchoring, he has also proved to be a versatile actor in his showbiz career. While celebrating the 100th episode of Comedy Utsavam, one of its chief judges Guinness Pakru aka actor Ajay Kumar had mentioned that if the show is a big ship then the host Mithun is its strong anchor. In a conversation with us, he talks about his popular show, career as an RJ in Dubai, his acting ventures and more.The journey so farI always aspired to be in the media field from a young age. Soon after college, I was lucky to host my first television show, Butterflies, which was a campus programme aired in the early 2000s. Later I got to host many more TV and stage shows as well. The turning point in my life was the interview with actress Abhirami on Surya TV, which many liked. The shows like Little Masters on Asianet in 2001 and many serials followed. Most of the roles I played in serials had the shades of grey, but theymade me a familiar face to the family audience. My villainous role in the serial Sthreejanman (Asianet) convinced director Joshiy sir to include me in his Dileep-starrer film Runway. Apart from being an actor and a host, I am also an RJ at a FM station in Dubai. Though a native of Thiruvananthapuram, I am settled in Dubai for the past 14 years with my wife Lakshmi Menon and our eight-year-old daughter Tanvi.Comedy Utsavam, a storehouse of talentDuring the initial episodes of the show, we were doubtful about the availability of talented artistes in Kerala. But as the show went on, we understood that the state is a storehouse of talented common man artistesn. Those who performed at the show informed more of their friends and through word of mouth, many more artistes came in. We do not have any age, sex or nativity based restrictions and our director Mithiilaj Abdul is very particular about it, just as I am. The programme also brought in a handful of physically challenged talents and I believe that giving them a platform to prove their skills with dignity, is the right way to empower them.The show recently celebrated its 100th episode, on which we included all the participants who performed in the earlier episodes. After their first performances on the show, almost all have succeeded in getting many stage shows, even abroad! We do follow up with them and are in touch with our artistes. As part for the 100th episode's celebrations we have also kicked-off a Comedy Utsava yathra in which we would travel to rural and urban parts of all 14 districts in our state and conduct auditions. We began from Kasaragod on January 1, this year.The show has taught me many life lessonsI have come across many people who have said that Comedy Utsavam has changed their lives. Mani Thamara is such a contstant. He used to compose music for the late actor Kalabhavan Mani’s folk songs but kept a low profile. After his first performance on the show he received more stages. When he came to perform later, he told us, “Brother, it's after coming here that I had meals made of good quality rice, for the first time in my life!” The show taught me too many life lessons, and I could understand how privileged I am. Revealing the life stories of contestants have led to teary episodes often, but we don't want to play the sentimental violin background track and dramatise it. The show has helped me to focus more on realistic anchoring as well.Up NextAt present I am committed to Comedy Utsavam only and I also work as the programme director of a Dubai-based FM radio. I also have two films in my kitty - Kuttanpillayude Shivarathri which will be released in March and Baby Sam, a children's movie directed by Jeevan Bose, in which I play the lead.</td>\n",

Though agriculture is the subject where the states have to be on board for success of many schemes, the government’s focus in the budget is likely to be on allocating more fund for centrally-sponsored schemes”, said the official.The funds for expanding e-NAM’s footprints, cold chain, irrigation infrastructure, micro-irrigation and crop insurance scheme are expected to be increased.“Farmers need input subsidies and minimum support price (MSP) for their produce, but these two alone cannot solve the problem”, said the official while emphasising on the need to create robust market mechanisms for farm produce so that farmers don’t face a crisis in a good crop year like what the rural Gujarat faced.The crop year 2016-17 (July-June) had seen record foodgrain production of 275.68 million tonnes. Besides, more farmers came under the network of the new crop insurance. Number of farmers, benefiting from crop insurance also increased in 2016-17 as compared to 2015-16.All these, however, do not seem to have addressed the problems. Horticulture production also reached record levels, but did not prove to be a boon for farmers. There have been report of distress selling from many states.“These are the worrying signs. Loss due to disaster can be tackled through insurance. But the problem of plenty (bumper production) can only be tackled through robust market system, cold chain and effective procurement mechanism. The 2018-19 budget is likely to address these issues”, said the official.Farmers in Saurashtra-Kutch region, where the BJP’s tally went down as compared to 2012, saw prices of cotton and groundnut produce slide. Though the Centre had increased MSP and the state had extended bonus on it, poor procurement had forced farmers to go for distress sales in open markets that fetched them much lower price than the MSP.  \n",

While Verenna Vendum and Beep, directed by Shivabharathi Kumaran and Shanmuga Sundar respectively, are in its post-production stage, Ucham, which has her paired opposite Balakrishna Kola, has completed its second schedule.Prerna says, “I play a Tamil girl in Verenna Vendum, which is set against a village backdrop. The film is about a couple whose relationship flourishes online. Beep has me in the role of an NRI who comes back home, and her life changes with an event — it is a mystery thriller.”The actress adds, “In Ucham, I will be seen as a Punjabi girl, a software employee who loves Chennai more than Mumbai.”Prerna, who forayed into filmdom with the Tollywood multi-starrer flick Rama Rama Krishna Krishna a few years ago, took a sabbatical to pursue higher studies. “I wanted to complete my education and it was the right time for me to do it. I had several offers while I was studying, and even I was keen to do films. I’m quite excited about all the three films that I’ve signed and I’m eagerly looking forward to the projects which came to me simultaneously,” she says with a smile.  \n",

       "3  From his debut show Butterflies aired on Asianet Plus to Flowers TV’s popular programme Comedy Utsavam, Mithun Ramesh has come a long way in the television industry.Apart from anchoring, he has also proved to be a versatile actor in his showbiz career. While celebrating the 100th episode of Comedy Utsavam, one of its chief judges Guinness Pakru aka actor Ajay Kumar had mentioned that if the show is a big ship then the host Mithun is its strong anchor. In a conversation with us, he talks about his popular show, career as an RJ in Dubai, his acting ventures and more.The journey so farI always aspired to be in the media field from a young age. Soon after college, I was lucky to host my first television show, Butterflies, which was a campus programme aired in the early 2000s. Later I got to host many more TV and stage shows as well. The turning point in my life was the interview with actress Abhirami on Surya TV, which many liked. The shows like Little Masters on Asianet in 2001 and many serials followed. Most of the roles I played in serials had the shades of grey, but theymade me a familiar face to the family audience. My villainous role in the serial Sthreejanman (Asianet) convinced director Joshiy sir to include me in his Dileep-starrer film Runway. Apart from being an actor and a host, I am also an RJ at a FM station in Dubai. Though a native of Thiruvananthapuram, I am settled in Dubai for the past 14 years with my wife Lakshmi Menon and our eight-year-old daughter Tanvi.Comedy Utsavam, a storehouse of talentDuring the initial episodes of the show, we were doubtful about the availability of talented artistes in Kerala. But as the show went on, we understood that the state is a storehouse of talented common man artistesn. Those who performed at the show informed more of their friends and through word of mouth, many more artistes came in. We do not have any age, sex or nativity based restrictions and our director Mithiilaj Abdul is very particular about it, just as I am. The programme also brought in a handful of physically challenged talents and I believe that giving them a platform to prove their skills with dignity, is the right way to empower them.The show recently celebrated its 100th episode, on which we included all the participants who performed in the earlier episodes. After their first performances on the show, almost all have succeeded in getting many stage shows, even abroad! We do follow up with them and are in touch with our artistes. As part for the 100th episode's celebrations we have also kicked-off a Comedy Utsava yathra in which we would travel to rural and urban parts of all 14 districts in our state and conduct auditions. We began from Kasaragod on January 1, this year.The show has taught me many life lessonsI have come across many people who have said that Comedy Utsavam has changed their lives. Mani Thamara is such a contstant. He used to compose music for the late actor Kalabhavan Mani’s folk songs but kept a low profile. After his first performance on the show he received more stages. When he came to perform later, he told us, “Brother, it's after coming here that I had meals made of good quality rice, for the first time in my life!” The show taught me too many life lessons, and I could understand how privileged I am. Revealing the life stories of contestants have led to teary episodes often, but we don't want to play the sentimental violin background track and dramatise it. The show has helped me to focus more on realistic anchoring as well.Up NextAt present I am committed to Comedy Utsavam only and I also work as the programme director of a Dubai-based FM radio. I also have two films in my kitty - Kuttanpillayude Shivarathri which will be released in March and Baby Sam, a children's movie directed by Jeevan Bose, in which I play the lead.  \n",

       "      <td>It’s being speculated that Karthi plays a farmer in his film with Pandiraj, titled Kadai Kutty Singam. While there’s no official confirmation on what his role is, we hear that the actor recently shot a rekla sequence for it.A source says, “Pandiraj is shooting for the film in Karaikudi, and the team will be present there for about 15 days. While he revealed the Tamil and Telugu titles of the film on Pongal, the director shot a rekla sequence recently. The scene was filmed over three days in the presence of a huge crowd. Karthi, who will be seen in the rural avatar, put in a lot of effort to ensure the sequence comes out authentically.”We hear the team has planned its next schedule in Tirunelveli.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The mood at Nehru Stadium was jubilant, with over 1,000 special children participating in the annual Kreeda-Olympics For Special Children. The event, by Inner Wheel Club of Madras Fort, was even more special this year as it had special children participating from across Tamil Nadu. With two events — running and ball throw — being conducted, almost every other participant went away with medals. Sumathi Bafna, president of the club, says, “This is our ninth year and we wanted to do something special. Usually, we have about 300-odd students participating in this competition. But we wanted to make it big and invited special children from across the state. We reached out to the schools several weeks in advance and the schools’ coaches have been giving them training. On the day of the event, all the children were all charged up about participating in the sporting events.”Since 1,000 children had participated, Sumathi conducted multiple events at the same venue. “We didn’t want the children to sit idle. So, we conducted games at four different places at the venue. We divided the kids into different levels to make it easier. Children in the age group 6-15 took part in all the events,” she says. MS Nagarajan, Asia Pacific Senior Sports Manager For Special Olympics, who was the competition director for this event, says, “There were four categories based on age-groups of the children: below 8, 8-11 and 12-15 years took part in the event. Everyone present at the event had two chances to compete. So, everyone was eventually a winner in one event or the other. Apart from the age groups, we also divided them according to gender and capability. For instance, we conducted 50m race for children below eight years of age. Also, the running races were divided into two — one for those running fast, and one for those who ran a little slower. This way, everyone could be accommodated. We had a separate race and ball throw for children with multiple disabilities. It is not fair to put them all into one category, so all of them were divided according to their abilities.”Prior training played an important role, says Nagarajan. “Training and orientation programmes were conducted prior to the event. So, coaches from the respective schools were given a brief on what will be expected of the students the event. Apart from the schools that volunteered to participate in the event, we even had some surprise last minute entries,” he says.And the participation has only motivated the students, he says, “Nobody is a loser. Everyone proved their mettle in some event or the other, eventually walking away with a medal. We believe that this added a strong therapeutic value to the students and that this was something that we achieved without any medicine. It gave them recognition and boosted their self-esteem making the parents, too, happy in the process.”Apart from the competition, Sumathi says that they created a festival mood for the kids. “We gave them plenty of snacks, stationery kits, school bags with books, and so on. We also had a tattoo zone and play area. All the students were provided lunch. It looked more like a carnival. These things only motivate the kids, help them find new friendships and relaxes them,” she signs off.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It is time to rephrase the saying ‘It is like cancer and there is no cure’ by putting an end to the fear of being diagnosed by the dreadful disease. Five women cancer survivors from different parts of the country are going to do exactly that by walking the ramp on January 31 in Kochi to show the world that cancer is not the end of life.The aim of the show is to create cancer awareness and spread the message that one can fight cancer with early detection.Kottayam-based Megha Kuriakose, who survived Hodgkin’s lymphoma is one among the five, tells us that the impact on people when cancer survivors speak is actually greater than any other kind of awareness. “There is a notion that death is the only outcome of cancer. But it isn’t true. I was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 25 and I took the right treatment at the right time. Now, six years have passed, I am married and have a baby as well. I have observed that people are more convinced when I speak as I am a survivor. So I decided to spread the word,” she says.The others who are walking the ramp are Preetha Menon and Sherly from Kochi, Yogi from Mumbai and Leena Joseph from Gujarat.On the initiative, Dubai-based Premi Mathew, the coordinator of the show, tells us that the idea was suggested by Sherly’s daughter Priya Rose, who is a stylist.“I was in search of an idea other than hair donation to spread cancer awareness and Priya asked me why not a ramp walk with cancer survivors? It needs a lot of courage to face the world post cancer treatment and we decided to go ahead. A single post on my social media page got us here to Kochi,” says Premi, who also runs a campaign Protect Your Mom that encourages children to support their mothers to have proper cancer check-ups.“I never thought I would find so many women to support the cause especially because we live in a society that has a lot of stigma about cancer and majority hesitate to reveal that they are cancer survivors,” she adds.Single parent Preetha Menon, who is also part of the group of 'models’, agrees that it is high time for people came out of the fear and stigma. “I see a lot of cancer survivors around me who confine themselves to their houses as they think there is no hope. Even I had similar thoughts once. But being depressed was not an option for me as when I was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, my daughter and I were grieving the sudden demise of my husband,” she says.A strong support system if often half the relief, she says. “My daughter was my ray of hope and I had to live for her. So, I built up my confidence and with the support of my family and doctor, I recovered. However, I faced a lot of questions from people around on how I could be like this when I am ailing from a dreadful disease. If I had listened to those ‘beware messages’, I wouldn’t be here right now,” says Preethi, who along with the other survivors will gather in the city today to share their stories and for rehearsals ahead of the ramp walk.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It all started with a bucket and broom for this Sakleshpur boy. Now popular as Kannada rapper Chandan Shetty, the 28-year-old’s tryst with music began with him experimenting with rhythm on his morning routine of cleaning his father’s tiny store with buckets of water and the rustling sound of the broom. Today, the same boy is the winner of Bigg Boss Season 5. “I’m not surprised that he won. In fact, even when we saw him off as he left for the show, I had an inkling that he’d win. Of course, every mother has this feeling of wanting to see her child emerge winner. But as the days passed and I watched the show from an audience’s point of view, I felt Chandan was the most eligible candidate to win. Everyone said that every year, the candidate they expected to win has never won. This is the first time that a deserving individual has won,” says a proud Prema Paramesh, Chandan’s mother. So, what was the one quality according to her that sealed the deal for her son? “His deep thoughts and philosophical outlook on the show won over a lot of people. Chandan’s way of dealing with situations with maturity and his interactions with Niveditha (Gowda) have been especially endearing,” points out Prema. His father, Paramesh, adds that Chandan’s love for Kannada has been another factor that has contributed to his success. “From the beginning he was clear about making Kannada popular on the global platform. Whether it is Haalagode, 3 Peg or Tequila, he has popularized Kannada rap music, a genre that was ignored until now,” says Paramesh.My cousin, Suraj, is friends with Chandan and that’s how I met him. Dhruva, Suraj, Chandan and I cut a music album called Down South Rhythm about eight years ago, after which Chandan stayed with us in Bengaluru. I then called Arjun Janya, who mentored Chandan— Chiranjeevi Sarja, Chandan’s friendChandan was a mild and shy boy who kept to himself. His passion for music or playing instruments hadn’t been explored in school. Looking back, Maybe he didn’t get the right platform back then. As hiskannada teacher, I am glad he is popular as a Kannada rapper — Sadashiva Holla, Chandan’s teacher</td>\n",

While there’s no official confirmation on what his role is, we hear that the actor recently shot a rekla sequence for it.A source says, “Pandiraj is shooting for the film in Karaikudi, and the team will be present there for about 15 days. While he revealed the Tamil and Telugu titles of the film on Pongal, the director shot a rekla sequence recently. The scene was filmed over three days in the presence of a huge crowd. Karthi, who will be seen in the rural avatar, put in a lot of effort to ensure the sequence comes out authentically.”We hear the team has planned its next schedule in Tirunelveli.  \n",

       "2  The mood at Nehru Stadium was jubilant, with over 1,000 special children participating in the annual Kreeda-Olympics For Special Children. The event, by Inner Wheel Club of Madras Fort, was even more special this year as it had special children participating from across Tamil Nadu. With two events — running and ball throw — being conducted, almost every other participant went away with medals. Sumathi Bafna, president of the club, says, “This is our ninth year and we wanted to do something special. Usually, we have about 300-odd students participating in this competition. But we wanted to make it big and invited special children from across the state. We reached out to the schools several weeks in advance and the schools’ coaches have been giving them training. On the day of the event, all the children were all charged up about participating in the sporting events.”Since 1,000 children had participated, Sumathi conducted multiple events at the same venue. “We didn’t want the children to sit idle. So, we conducted games at four different places at the venue. We divided the kids into different levels to make it easier. Children in the age group 6-15 took part in all the events,” she says. MS Nagarajan, Asia Pacific Senior Sports Manager For Special Olympics, who was the competition director for this event, says, “There were four categories based on age-groups of the children: below 8, 8-11 and 12-15 years took part in the event. Everyone present at the event had two chances to compete. So, everyone was eventually a winner in one event or the other. Apart from the age groups, we also divided them according to gender and capability. For instance, we conducted 50m race for children below eight years of age. Also, the running races were divided into two — one for those running fast, and one for those who ran a little slower. This way, everyone could be accommodated. We had a separate race and ball throw for children with multiple disabilities. It is not fair to put them all into one category, so all of them were divided according to their abilities.”Prior training played an important role, says Nagarajan. “Training and orientation programmes were conducted prior to the event. So, coaches from the respective schools were given a brief on what will be expected of the students the event. Apart from the schools that volunteered to participate in the event, we even had some surprise last minute entries,” he says.And the participation has only motivated the students, he says, “Nobody is a loser. Everyone proved their mettle in some event or the other, eventually walking away with a medal. We believe that this added a strong therapeutic value to the students and that this was something that we achieved without any medicine. It gave them recognition and boosted their self-esteem making the parents, too, happy in the process.”Apart from the competition, Sumathi says that they created a festival mood for the kids. “We gave them plenty of snacks, stationery kits, school bags with books, and so on. We also had a tattoo zone and play area. All the students were provided lunch. It looked more like a carnival. These things only motivate the kids, help them find new friendships and relaxes them,” she signs off.  \n",

Five women cancer survivors from different parts of the country are going to do exactly that by walking the ramp on January 31 in Kochi to show the world that cancer is not the end of life.The aim of the show is to create cancer awareness and spread the message that one can fight cancer with early detection.Kottayam-based Megha Kuriakose, who survived Hodgkin’s lymphoma is one among the five, tells us that the impact on people when cancer survivors speak is actually greater than any other kind of awareness. “There is a notion that death is the only outcome of cancer. But it isn’t true. I was diagnosed with the disease at the age of 25 and I took the right treatment at the right time. Now, six years have passed, I am married and have a baby as well. I have observed that people are more convinced when I speak as I am a survivor. So I decided to spread the word,” she says.The others who are walking the ramp are Preetha Menon and Sherly from Kochi, Yogi from Mumbai and Leena Joseph from Gujarat.On the initiative, Dubai-based Premi Mathew, the coordinator of the show, tells us that the idea was suggested by Sherly’s daughter Priya Rose, who is a stylist.“I was in search of an idea other than hair donation to spread cancer awareness and Priya asked me why not a ramp walk with cancer survivors? It needs a lot of courage to face the world post cancer treatment and we decided to go ahead. A single post on my social media page got us here to Kochi,” says Premi, who also runs a campaign Protect Your Mom that encourages children to support their mothers to have proper cancer check-ups.“I never thought I would find so many women to support the cause especially because we live in a society that has a lot of stigma about cancer and majority hesitate to reveal that they are cancer survivors,” she adds.Single parent Preetha Menon, who is also part of the group of 'models’, agrees that it is high time for people came out of the fear and stigma. “I see a lot of cancer survivors around me who confine themselves to their houses as they think there is no hope. Even I had similar thoughts once. But being depressed was not an option for me as when I was diagnosed with cancer in 2013, my daughter and I were grieving the sudden demise of my husband,” she says.A strong support system if often half the relief, she says. “My daughter was my ray of hope and I had to live for her. So, I built up my confidence and with the support of my family and doctor, I recovered. However, I faced a lot of questions from people around on how I could be like this when I am ailing from a dreadful disease. If I had listened to those ‘beware messages’, I wouldn’t be here right now,” says Preethi, who along with the other survivors will gather in the city today to share their stories and for rehearsals ahead of the ramp walk.  \n",

Now popular as Kannada rapper Chandan Shetty, the 28-year-old’s tryst with music began with him experimenting with rhythm on his morning routine of cleaning his father’s tiny store with buckets of water and the rustling sound of the broom. Today, the same boy is the winner of Bigg Boss Season 5. “I’m not surprised that he won. In fact, even when we saw him off as he left for the show, I had an inkling that he’d win. Of course, every mother has this feeling of wanting to see her child emerge winner. But as the days passed and I watched the show from an audience’s point of view, I felt Chandan was the most eligible candidate to win. Everyone said that every year, the candidate they expected to win has never won. This is the first time that a deserving individual has won,” says a proud Prema Paramesh, Chandan’s mother. So, what was the one quality according to her that sealed the deal for her son? “His deep thoughts and philosophical outlook on the show won over a lot of people. Chandan’s way of dealing with situations with maturity and his interactions with Niveditha (Gowda) have been especially endearing,” points out Prema. His father, Paramesh, adds that Chandan’s love for Kannada has been another factor that has contributed to his success. “From the beginning he was clear about making Kannada popular on the global platform. Whether it is Haalagode, 3 Peg or Tequila, he has popularized Kannada rap music, a genre that was ignored until now,” says Paramesh.My cousin, Suraj, is friends with Chandan and that’s how I met him. Dhruva, Suraj, Chandan and I cut a music album called Down South Rhythm about eight years ago, after which Chandan stayed with us in Bengaluru. I then called Arjun Janya, who mentored Chandan— Chiranjeevi Sarja, Chandan’s friendChandan was a mild and shy boy who kept to himself. His passion for music or playing instruments hadn’t been explored in school. Looking back, Maybe he didn’t get the right platform back then. As hiskannada teacher, I am glad he is popular as a Kannada rapper — Sadashiva Holla, Chandan’s teacher  "

However, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not yet formed a separate committee to look after the affairs of the municipal schools, as mandated by the state government.The municipal school board was dissolved in June 2017 after the end of its tenure. An order, issued by the commissioner’s office, had stated that the PMC would set up an education department, which would look after the functioning of the primary and secondary education divisions.As per the order, the civic body’s central stores depot had been made given the responsibility to purchase stationery and other material for the department. The PMC’s finance and audit departments were to control the financial transactions.Civic officials said there were a total of 287 primary schools and 30 secondary schools run by the PMC, which should now function under the PMC’s education department. The department is to be headed by the additional municipal commissioner (general). The education officer is to oversee the secondary division, while the administrative officer (education) is to look after the primary division. The staff working in school board are to be shifted to other departments as per their ranks.“Currently, the civic officials are performing the duties of the board. The state government had given orders to form a committee, but that has not been done yet. Considering the future of these students, an education committee should be formed,” said a proposal tabled by corporator Yogesh Sasane.Sasane’s proposal has been tabled before the PMC’s general body. “The proposal is to be approved by the general body. The decision about forming the committee will be taken after a green signal from the elected members,” said a senior official of the PMC.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Anasuya means the woman who sees the good side in a human being,” says Nik Gugger, the first MP in Switzerland of Indian-origin, while talking about his biological mother, whom he knows only from his adoptive parents. Though she gave him away on the day of his birth, Nik feels that she has indeed become an embodiment of goodness by trusting the humanitarian side of people, when she entrusted him to safer hands.Born in Udupi in 1970, Nik was adopted by a Swiss couple who, a few months before, had taken charge of the Nettur Technical Training Foundation (NTTF) in Thalassery, Kannur. According to him, it must have been God’s plan that he was born exactly the day when his adoptive parents came to Udupi, Basel Mission Hospital, to get their first medical check-up. They took him along to Thalassery and offered him a new life.Nik’s life story garnered attention during the first Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) conference held in New Delhi on January 8 -9, 2018, which saw a unique meeting of parliamentarians of Indian origin from different parts of the world.The 48-year-old is all nostalgic, when he says that although he is born in Karnataka, his memories of India reside in Thalassery and are still as vivid as ever. Nik talks to us about those memories and rekindling his relationships in Kerala:You had spent a few years in Kerala in your childhood. What do you remember?My memories of God’s Own Country are very dear to me. I was four years old so I don’t remember much. However, from the photos, I remember playing with the neighbour — a baby girl in a big garden and also our dog Uzzi. With old tooth brushes and water, we rubbed the dirt off the wheels of daddy’s car. We also had an old tyre fixed on a long rope from the beams of the house roof as a swing. Incidentally, after seeing me on TV and newspapers recently, the girl contacted me and now her family is in touch with ours.I also remember the beach. Usually just before the sunset when my dad finished working, we used to go down to the seashore for a swim. Of course my part was to play in the sand with my toys or sit on daddy’s arms as he stepped into the waters, while Uzzi watched me. I would like to see the Nilgiris again, where we spent the hot weeks before monsoon.As a child I didn’t eat hot curry, I got to know and liked it only later. I also loved the fruits of Kerala such as tender coconut, jackfruit, banana and mango.Do you remember the language?When I was about two years old, my mother felt that I was speaking in Malayalam. She asked the maids what I was saying and they said they too did not understand it. At the end, they found out that I was only mimicking the sounds and rhythms of Malayalam because I constantly heard the two ladies chatting.When did you leave for Switzerland?My parents returned with me to Switzerland when the project was given to Indian hands in 1974. We, however, returned in 2009, when NTTF celebrated its golden jubilee.Did you visit Kerala before that?Yes. I came back to Thalassery in 1989 and rekindled my old relationships. It was like I was connecting with my own land and I went on to visit Kerala in 2002, 2006 and 2009. I am planning to come this year in March as well.Whenever I come to the State, I love to visit the Gundert Bungalow on the Illikunnu Hill, where we were living, see the grand garden and look at the sea. Besides that, it is the people I like to visit, old friends.Have you made many friends from Kerala?Yes. I usually visit the present principal of NTTF Sadasivan and its former secretary Raghunatha Kurup. Sometimes, I visit my mother’s doctor, Mrs Lila Menon and Adarsh, who live in Kozhikode, and ‘akka’ Diana Agnes, the maid who carried me around. I am in touch with an ayurveda doctor there and I always make sure to go for a back waters trip.In my earlier visits, I made acquaintance with the late Murkot Ramunny, who founded the Gundert Foundation School near the old Fort of Thalassery. The school serves children of financially backward families and there are some of my friends in Switzerland who contribute to its maintenance.Last time I also met current parliament member of Thalassery, Richard Hay, while I was associated with Ramunny, which also helped me to know more about the land and to plan my work for its benefit.Tell us about being a PIO and a parliament member of SwitzerlandAs I grew up in Switzerland with Swiss parents, I feel completely Swiss. But as I am an Indian as well and visited my birth country different times, I would like to see it prosper and develop in a sound and tolerant way. Therefore, in parliament, I am a member of the foreign commission, with the goal to keep good contact with the world.Could you tell us about your family?I married my wife Beatrice in 1994. She is a paediatric nurse and loves yodelling, gymnastics, skiing and meditation. I am very grateful to her for supporting my political career.We have three children. Our daughter loves skating as well as cheer-leading and starts her internship in business administration soon. The middle one, son, likes mathematics best, loves football and plays the guitar. Our youngest son is fond of drawing cars, airplanes and tanks.My parents are very proud of me. In politics, my father is my role model as he was in the cantonal government of Switzerland. I often talk to him to get his views. A mix of old and new views sometimes leads to sound solutions. My mother and my sisters are also dear to me and we meet whenever possible.Do you have plans of find your roots in India?Yes and no. Because my parents promised my biological mother that they will never search for her, I intend on keeping it. Personally, I do not wish to intrude into her family and disturb her, if she is still alive. No mother will abandon her child without a strong reason. At least I’m very thankful to her that she gave birth to me in a hospital in Udupi. Once in the realm of God, I shall ask Him to tell and show me all which is still a secret to me.</td>\n",

However, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has not yet formed a separate committee to look after the affairs of the municipal schools, as mandated by the state government.The municipal school board was dissolved in June 2017 after the end of its tenure. An order, issued by the commissioner’s office, had stated that the PMC would set up an education department, which would look after the functioning of the primary and secondary education divisions.As per the order, the civic body’s central stores depot had been made given the responsibility to purchase stationery and other material for the department. The PMC’s finance and audit departments were to control the financial transactions.Civic officials said there were a total of 287 primary schools and 30 secondary schools run by the PMC, which should now function under the PMC’s education department. The department is to be headed by the additional municipal commissioner (general). The education officer is to oversee the secondary division, while the administrative officer (education) is to look after the primary division. The staff working in school board are to be shifted to other departments as per their ranks.“Currently, the civic officials are performing the duties of the board. The state government had given orders to form a committee, but that has not been done yet.

       "3  Anasuya means the woman who sees the good side in a human being,” says Nik Gugger, the first MP in Switzerland of Indian-origin, while talking about his biological mother, whom he knows only from his adoptive parents. Though she gave him away on the day of his birth, Nik feels that she has indeed become an embodiment of goodness by trusting the humanitarian side of people, when she entrusted him to safer hands.Born in Udupi in 1970, Nik was adopted by a Swiss couple who, a few months before, had taken charge of the Nettur Technical Training Foundation (NTTF) in Thalassery, Kannur. According to him, it must have been God’s plan that he was born exactly the day when his adoptive parents came to Udupi, Basel Mission Hospital, to get their first medical check-up. They took him along to Thalassery and offered him a new life.Nik’s life story garnered attention during the first Persons of Indian Origin (PIO) conference held in New Delhi on January 8 -9, 2018, which saw a unique meeting of parliamentarians of Indian origin from different parts of the world.The 48-year-old is all nostalgic, when he says that although he is born in Karnataka, his memories of India reside in Thalassery and are still as vivid as ever. Nik talks to us about those memories and rekindling his relationships in Kerala:You had spent a few years in Kerala in your childhood. What do you remember?My memories of God’s Own Country are very dear to me. I was four years old so I don’t remember much. However, from the photos, I remember playing with the neighbour — a baby girl in a big garden and also our dog Uzzi. With old tooth brushes and water, we rubbed the dirt off the wheels of daddy’s car. We also had an old tyre fixed on a long rope from the beams of the house roof as a swing. Incidentally, after seeing me on TV and newspapers recently, the girl contacted me and now her family is in touch with ours.I also remember the beach. Usually just before the sunset when my dad finished working, we used to go down to the seashore for a swim. Of course my part was to play in the sand with my toys or sit on daddy’s arms as he stepped into the waters, while Uzzi watched me. I would like to see the Nilgiris again, where we spent the hot weeks before monsoon.As a child I didn’t eat hot curry, I got to know and liked it only later. I also loved the fruits of Kerala such as tender coconut, jackfruit, banana and mango.Do you remember the language?When I was about two years old, my mother felt that I was speaking in Malayalam. She asked the maids what I was saying and they said they too did not understand it. At the end, they found out that I was only mimicking the sounds and rhythms of Malayalam because I constantly heard the two ladies chatting.When did you leave for Switzerland?My parents returned with me to Switzerland when the project was given to Indian hands in 1974. We, however, returned in 2009, when NTTF celebrated its golden jubilee.Did you visit Kerala before that?Yes. I came back to Thalassery in 1989 and rekindled my old relationships. It was like I was connecting with my own land and I went on to visit Kerala in 2002, 2006 and 2009. I am planning to come this year in March as well.Whenever I come to the State, I love to visit the Gundert Bungalow on the Illikunnu Hill, where we were living, see the grand garden and look at the sea. Besides that, it is the people I like to visit, old friends.Have you made many friends from Kerala?Yes. I usually visit the present principal of NTTF Sadasivan and its former secretary Raghunatha Kurup. Sometimes, I visit my mother’s doctor, Mrs Lila Menon and Adarsh, who live in Kozhikode, and ‘akka’ Diana Agnes, the maid who carried me around. I am in touch with an ayurveda doctor there and I always make sure to go for a back waters trip.In my earlier visits, I made acquaintance with the late Murkot Ramunny, who founded the Gundert Foundation School near the old Fort of Thalassery. The school serves children of financially backward families and there are some of my friends in Switzerland who contribute to its maintenance.Last time I also met current parliament member of Thalassery, Richard Hay, while I was associated with Ramunny, which also helped me to know more about the land and to plan my work for its benefit.Tell us about being a PIO and a parliament member of SwitzerlandAs I grew up in Switzerland with Swiss parents, I feel completely Swiss. But as I am an Indian as well and visited my birth country different times, I would like to see it prosper and develop in a sound and tolerant way. Therefore, in parliament, I am a member of the foreign commission, with the goal to keep good contact with the world.Could you tell us about your family?I married my wife Beatrice in 1994. She is a paediatric nurse and loves yodelling, gymnastics, skiing and meditation. I am very grateful to her for supporting my political career.We have three children. Our daughter loves skating as well as cheer-leading and starts her internship in business administration soon. The middle one, son, likes mathematics best, loves football and plays the guitar. Our youngest son is fond of drawing cars, airplanes and tanks.My parents are very proud of me. In politics, my father is my role model as he was in the cantonal government of Switzerland. I often talk to him to get his views. A mix of old and new views sometimes leads to sound solutions. My mother and my sisters are also dear to me and we meet whenever possible.Do you have plans of find your roots in India?Yes and no. Because my parents promised my biological mother that they will never search for her, I intend on keeping it. Personally, I do not wish to intrude into her family and disturb her, if she is still alive. No mother will abandon her child without a strong reason. At least I’m very thankful to her that she gave birth to me in a hospital in Udupi. Once in the realm of God, I shall ask Him to tell and show me all which is still a secret to me.  \n",
